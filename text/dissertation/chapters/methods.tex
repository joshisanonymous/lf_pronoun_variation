  \section{Sampling approach and data collection}
    % Finding Creoles
      % Susberry (2004) used email lists, organizations, Creole ancestry conferences, Catholic churches, and universities to find participants (34)
        % For myself, the most effective approach was to visit small, local businesses and organizations and speak to customers and employees
        % Social media (reddit) and attending local Creole-centric events helped, as well, whereas churches were not responsive
          % Likewise, Susberry (2004) did not always have success with contacting churches but rather had most of her success with online surveys (51)
    % Frequency of each pronoun
      % 1st and 2nd person could be expected to be more frequent in speech (and CMC) than they would be in writing (Yates 1996:40-41, also citing Chafe 1982 and Fowler & Kress 1979)
  \section{Data coding}
    % Not only were participants anonymized but also non-participants and even famous or historical figures
      % Ethical data collection can be an issue when collecting information about non-participants as these people are not providing consent (Stark 2018:244)
    \subsection{Participants}
      % Racial coding
        % Several general approaches that include biracial people
          % The Five Identities for Mixed-Race People scheme includes 1) foreclosed identity (accepting without question a minority identity assigned by society), 2) single [minority] identity (chosen by the individual), 3) mixed identity (e.g., something hyphenated), 4) new race identity (e.g., "Biracial" or perhaps "Creole"), and 5) white identity (chosen by the individual) (Root 2003, as cited in Susberry 2004:23)
        % Susberry (2004) classified Creoles of Color following Rockquemore (1999) as Black, protean (shifting), or border (biracial) (33)
