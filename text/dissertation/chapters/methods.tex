  \section{Data coding}
    % Not only were participants anonymized but also non-participants and even famous or historical figures
      % Ethical data collection can be an issue when collecting information about non-participants as these people are not providing consent (Stark 2018:244)
    \subsection{Participants}
      % Susberry (2004) classified Creoles of Color following Rockquemore (1999) as Black, protean (shifting), or border (biracial) (33)
