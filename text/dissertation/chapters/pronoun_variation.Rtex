\chapter{Subject Pronoun Variation in F\&C}
  \label{chap:pronoun_variation}
  Markers used to place individuals into racialized categories exist in many forms.
  \textcite{omi_racial_2015} often referred to ``corporeal markers'' of race, whereas \textcite{purnell_perceptual_1999} showed that a lone utterance of \sent{hello} was often sufficient for listeners to place the speaker into a racial category.
  Racialization is not predicated on the existence of such markers, and it may even be possible to have racialization without them, but they are a regular feature for obvious reasons.
  If one's goal is to racialize a group as less than human in order to justify exploiting them, then it is helpful to be able to readily identify individuals as belonging to that racialized group through some salient feature such as physical characteristics, speech, clothing, lifestyle, beliefs, or any other feature that may be used to distinguish one set of people from another.
  % The relevance of looking at differences and similarities in the speech of Creoles and Cajuns
    % Weber (1921/1978) argued that political community "inspires the belief in common ethnicity" but that differences in language among the so-called ethnic group's members that come about can destroy it (389)
  
  In the case of Creoles and Cajuns in Louisiana, there are certainly features other than speech that potentially function as salient markers that one is a member of one group or the other.
  As already discussed in section \ref{sec:creole_history}, skin color can function as a marker of Creole membership, but Creoles of color have also asserted that cultural features can be important factors, some salient examples of which included cuisine, Zydeco music, Catholic faith, dress, and participation in cultural event such as \foreign{Mardi gras}.
  Of course, another important factor was ``Creole French language and manner of speech'' \parencite[pp.~57-58]{susberry_racial_2004}.
  Given the vague glottonym of the former, it is perhaps most appropriate to understand this as being able to speak F\&C versus only being able to speak English.
  The objective for this chapter, however, is to carry out a more fine-grained examination by looking at F\&C subject pronoun systems to determine if Creole and Cajun identities are marked within the use of F\&C itself.
  If so, this would not only be evidence for the continued social importance of language variation in heritage languages, but more importantly for the present study, this would support the idea that Creoles and/or Cajuns have been racialized.
  Indications for subject pronoun variation between Creoles and Cajuns in the literature will be discussed as section \ref{sec:pronoun_structure} as will the structure of the subject pronoun system in general.
  The analysis carried out on the data gathered for this study will then be given a quantitative analysis in sections \ref{sec:pronoun_methods}, \ref{sec:pronoun_results}, and \ref{sec:pronoun_discussion}.
  Before that, however, it will be necessary to take a somewhat lengthy detour into the distinctions between French and Creole as they are spoken in Louisiana.

  \section{French vs Creole}
    \label{sec:french_vs_creole}
    The approach used here involved analyzing French and Creole together as one might do in cases where there is no controversy over whether the two varieties in question are part of the same language or not, using the unique and unmarked label \lexi{F\&C} to refer to this grouping in order to avoid implying a hierarchy between French and Creole and to avoid, as much as possible, taking a sociopolitical stance on the question of whether these are indeed one or two distinct languages.
    As will be discussed in this section, aggregating data from all French-related speech varieties in Louisiana was a methodological choice deemed necessary given that the focus of this study is on race and ethnicity which have rather complicated relationships with language labels for these varieties \parencite{klingler_language_2003}.
    However, even the appearance of taking a sociopolitical stance on the status of French and Creole as distinct languages is controversial, particularly among creolists and Creole activists in light of power dynamics between Creoles and Cajuns \parencite{giancarlo_dont_2019} as well as questions about whether Creole is best revitalized by aligning the variety more closely with French as the latter's preservation has more institutional support and resources or by distinguishing it from French in order to avoid erasure of Creole as nothing more than a lesser dialect of French.
    The following is therefore justification for my methodological choice.
    % Somewhat similar to Benor's (2010) explanation that, when analyzing language from her ethnolinguistic repertoire framework, it is "moot" whether one is discussing ethnic variation or ethnolects since the focus is not on language labeling practices but rather on fluid linguistic structure (170)

    French and Creole are not the only French-related varieties that have been said to exist in Louisiana.
    The different ways in which these have been divided and the many names given to them itself suggests an intimate connection if the simple fact that they all are indeed French-related does not indicate just that on its own.
    One such variety has been referred to as Colonial French \parencite[p.~33]{brasseaux_french_2005}, Plantation Society French (\citeauthor{klingler_language_2003}, \citeyear[p.~77]{klingler_language_2003}; \citeauthor{picone_situation_2005}, \citeyear[p.~147]{picone_situation_2005}), Standard Louisiana French \parencite[p.~323]{lane_notes_1934}, \foreign{le vieux français créole}\footnote{
      Old Creole French
    } \parencite[p.~48]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}, and Louisiana French \parencite[p.~37]{brown_pronominal_1988}.
    This variety has at times been described as the lingua franca and official language of colonial Louisiana \parencite[p.~33]{brasseaux_french_2005}, the variety spoken by Creoles in the sense of White descendents of French and Spanish colonists (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{lane_notes_1934}, \citeyear[p.~323]{lane_notes_1934}) or meaning those living in New Orleans or on plantations along the Mississippi \parencite[p.~43]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}, or simply a variety that developed in the 19th century within plantation society that resembled Standard French (\citeauthor{klingler_language_2003}, \citeyear[p.~77]{klingler_language_2003}).
    As is perhaps evident, the picture of this French variety is far from clear.
    Indeed, I am aware of no descriptive study of this variety and only very few reports in the literature of encounters with speakers, which perhaps explains the wide range of labels and delineations.
    One potential encounter comes from \textcite{johnson_louisiana_1976}, who reported meeting New Orleanians in the 1970s who themselves reported being acquainted with native speakers of ``New Orleanian French'' (p.~23), but this assumes that these reports are legitimate, accurate, and that this label refers to the same thing as all of the labels just mentioned.
    Another encounter is more of a self-report as Alcée Fortier, who was a native French speaker born in St James Parish but who spent most of his life in nearby New Orleans \parencite{plaisance_alcee_1909}, clearly distinguished his own French from that of Acadians and Creoles of color in his linguistic research \parencite[pp.~134-197]{fortier_louisiana_1894}.
    Colonial French along with the numerous other related labels appears to be more of a catch-all term for any French spoken natively by Louisianians of higher status than Creoles of color and Acadians/Cajuns, especially before the 20th century, making it a variety with truly fuzzy boundaries.
    
    One term used for the French discussed above was Louisiana French.
    However, Louisiana (Regional) French is the term that was proposed and taken up by linguists -- as well as to some extent non-linguists -- for what was previously referred to as Cajun French, the most widely spoken French-related language in Louisiana today (\citeauthor{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}, \citeyear[p.~281]{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}; \citeauthor{klingler_language_2003}, \citeyear[p.~77]{klingler_language_2003}).
    The latter term was considered inappropriate since many speakers are not descendents of Acadians, a point that both reifies the Cajun-Acadian origin myth discussed in section \ref{sec:cajun_history} and emphasizes linguistic structure in delineating the variety rather than speaker identities as another option would have been to propose additional glottonyms such as Houma Indian French.
    In fact, even on a structural level, \textcite{rottet_language_1995} provided significant evidence of systematic differences between the speech of Cajuns and Houma Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche.
    This is not to say that the wrong labeling choice was made but rather that these labels are sociopolitical and the boundaries of what they describe are rather fluid.
    % Louisiana Regional French (Dajko & Carmichael 2014)

    The final French-related variety often discussed in the literature is the creole of Louisiana.
    While researchers generally refer to this as Louisiana Creole today (\citeauthor{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}, \citeyear[pp.~280-281]{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}; \citeauthor{klingler_language_2003}, \citeyear[p.~77]{klingler_language_2003}; \citeauthor{mayeux_racial_2024}, \citeyear{mayeux_racial_2024}; \citeauthor{wendte_chronotopic_2022}, \citeyear{wendte_chronotopic_2022}), it has been referred to by a number of different names over time such as the Creole dialect \parencite[p.~134]{fortier_louisiana_1894}, Louisiana Creole Dialect \parencite{broussard_louisiana_1972}, Creole French (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~32]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{clifton_tracing_1975}, \citeyear[p.~109]{clifton_tracing_1975}), and Black Creole \parencite[p.~50]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}.
    These glottonyms often hint at a racialization of the variety, as in the latter example or through more denigrating labels that will not be reprinted here (\foreign{e.g.}, \citeauthor{bienvenu_negro-french_1933}, \citeyear{bienvenu_negro-french_1933}; \citeauthor{lane_notes_1934}, \citeyear[p.~323]{lane_notes_1934}).
    Importantly, this creole was often described as a dialect of French, highlighting a social hierarchy as well as a structural resemblance.
    As with Louisiana French, there is regional variation in Louisiana Creole that has led at least linguists to offer labels that would delineate it geographically such as St Martin Creole \parencite{morgan_lexicon_1960, morgan_structural_1959}, Pointe Coupée Creole \parencite[p.~70]{klingler_if_2003}, or, respectively referring to the same varieties, Mississippi Creole versus Têche Creole (\citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~21]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{speedy_mississippi_1994}, \citeyear{speedy_mississippi_1994}).
    Most have acknowledged what \textcite{broussard_louisiana_1972} called the ``marked differences between the dialects of the various parishes'' (p.~ix), just as most have also acknowledged the blurring of distinctions between Louisiana Creole and Louisiana French in the speech of many Louisianians (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[pp.~34-35]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{klingler_probleme_2005}, \citeyear{klingler_probleme_2005}).

    Speakers themselves further blur the lines between Louisiana Creole and Louisiana French in their own approaches to labeling.
    Just as with the glottonyms used by researchers, speakers of French-related varieties have especially referred to Louisiana Creole in a wide variety of ways such as River French \parencite[p.~37]{brown_pronominal_1988}, Gumbo French \parencite[p.~50]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}, along with \foreign{français plat}, \foreign{patois}, \foreign{couri vini}\footnote{
      The term \foreign{couri vini} has generally been documented as a pejorative term that mocks the way certain people speak, but it has more recently been reappropriated in a positive light by Creole language activists \parencite{landry_what_2016}.
    } and some plainly offensive labels (\citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~17]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~7]{rottet_language_1995}; \citeauthor{spitzer_cajuns_1977}, \citeyear{spitzer_cajuns_1977}; \citeauthor{valdman_place_1996}, \citeyear[p.~145]{valdman_place_1996}).
    However, the most common glottonyms used are likely \foreign{français}, \foreign{cadien}, and \foreign{créole}\footnote{
      French, Cajun, Creole
    } \parencite[p.~352]{klingler_probleme_2005}.
    When asked plainly without being pushed to be specific, French has been found to be the common response in communities regardless of whether those responding speak a variety that structurally resembles French or Creole, whereas when pushed to be specific, speakers have said things such as \foreign{français cadien} or simply \foreign{cadien}, for example (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~5]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{klingler_language_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~78-79]{klingler_language_2003}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~8]{rottet_language_1995}). % Le Menestrel (1999) also, but need to do ILL for book to check
    Relatedly, the speakers of Louisiana Creole with whom \textcite{klingler_if_2003} worked saw themselves as part of the ``broader world of people who speak `French''' (p.~128), a perspective that still appeared to be at play in the community during my fieldwork.
    For example, while ``French'' tables clearly attracted those who do not identify as Creole, there were at times Cajuns who attended whose speech had far more semblance to Louisiana Creole than French, implying that the advertising for these events did not dissuade speakers of Creole from attending as they did not necessarily see their language as not French, but rather it dissuaded those who identified as Creole from attending because that identity led them to label their language as not French even if it was very much like the speech of the other attendees.
    % It's not unusual to place languages under a label based on cultural traits of the speakers rather than the structure of their ways of speaking
      % Linguists once described Cangin as a variety of Serer because Wolofs in the area saw the cultural practices of both Cangin and Sereer speakers as being the same (Irvine & Gal 2000:57)
      % Creole speakers in Pointe Coupee (determined by the language structure) mostly call their language "créole" but sometimes also "français" or "cadien", though even when using the latter two glossonyms, speakers note that their language isn't like French from France or Cajun from Lafayette (Klingler 2003 "Turn":128)
        % Indeed, Bertrand & Beale (1965) characterized Black children from Pointe Coupee as being from English or "French" backgrounds rather than Creole backgrounds, yet Klingler by the 1990s was describing speakers in this parish as using Creole features almost to the exclusion of French marked variants

    Language naming practices not only fail to be indicative of distance in linguistic structure but mutual intelligibility is also not indicative of any extreme distance between the varieties aggregated as F\&C here.
    Indeed, despite my use of and much greater familiarity with Louisiana French (structurally defined) during interviews, miscommunication was no more common with Creole speakers than with French speakers.
    One poignant example came from a Cajun whose speech was very Creole-oriented who, during an interview, expressed such a strong stance that his speech was French that he claimed to not be able to always understand those who he identified as Creole, who therefore in his view spoke Creole.
    Cases of speakers who claim to lack mutual intelligibility certainly exist, but they may be driven more by ideologies of identity rather than a legitimate inability to understand.
    
    This idea that French and Creole are not mutually intelligible, nor even that Standard French and Louisiana French are mutually intelligible, was a common theme during the early years of French immersion programs in the state as Standard French was the medium of instruction.
    It was claimed that Louisiana French speakers in the 1970s were unable to understand the language used in schools that was qualified as ``a different, unintelligible, language'' \parencite[Waddell, 1993, as cited in][p.~40]{lindner_attitudes_2008}.
    It is not clear if this claim represents a situation that existed only at a particular time or in a particular part of Louisiana or perhaps only for particular people who, like my interviewee, had seemingly denied themselves the right to fully comprehend what they were hearing.
    In any case, there have been reports from various times and places that have contradicted the above, especially when referring to speakers of Creole understanding speakeres of French.
    Speakers of Creole in Pointe Coupée in the early 1990s discussed being able to successfully communicate with French speakers from both inside and outside of Louisiana even if some French speakers described having some comprehension difficulty themselves \parencite[p.~128]{klingler_if_2003}, and \textcite{neumann_creole_1985} reported creolophones in St Martin Parish in the early 1980s as being able to understand Louisiana French (p.~29).
    Similarly, \textcite{baronian_influence_2005} did not report any problems in conducting interviews in the early 2000s with French and Creole speakers in the parishes of Vermilion, Lafourche, and St Martin in which he spoke his native Quebec French (p.~137).
    While the question of language versus dialect is a sociopolitical one with little to do with mutual intelligibility, in terms of structure, it is clear that the French-related varieties of Louisiana are similar enough to each other and even to French spoken outside of Louisiana to facilitate comprehension and thus justify aggregating the two together for linguistic analyses.
    % Maybe claims of misunderstandig are due to opposition to SF in schools more so than real unintelligibility?
      % Most parents of immersion students wanted at least some SF taught to their children (75%) with 38% preferring that only SF be taught (Tornquist 2000:262)

    The sociopolitical question of distinguishing varieties as discrete languages or dialects of a language is of course an important one.
    Famously, that very question was at the center of the Oakland School Board Ebonics controversy, which centered on convincing the federal government that African-American English was distinct enough from Standard American English to justify the school as eligible for bilingual education funds \parencite{wolfram_language_1998}.
    An example of the opposite argument comes from \textcite{degraff_linguists_2005} whose concern for the delegitimization of creoles as languages argued against the idea advanced by some (\citeauthor{ringe_indo-european_2002}, \citeyear[p.~63-64]{ringe_indo-european_2002}; \citeauthor{thomason_language_1988}, \citeyear{thomason_language_1988}) that they are not genetically related to their lexifiers due to the ways in which they come about.
    In the case of Louisiana Creole, activists have alternatively sought to decouple this variety from French with the same goal in mind as DeGraff: to import greater legitimacy on it \parencite[pp.~11-12]{mayeux_language_2024}.
    With aggregating French and Creole as F\&C in this study, the goal was not to cast judgement on these varied approaches and arguments for establishing a variety as a language or dialect but rather to employ an abstracted term that avoids inadvertantly entering into that conversation as much as possible.
    The use of F\&C here is a methodological decision based on structural congruities only.
    % Even in accepted monolingual situations, it's important to distinguish between the languages of individuals and community languages
      % Pierrehumbert (2012) acknowledged that we can conceptualize lexicons at either the individual or the community level (173)
      % Fasold (1991) described treating speech communities as sharing structural constraints as "fatally flawed" (9-10)
        % Meaning that members of a same community do not all necessarily have the same grammars in their heads
      % Horvath & D. Sankoff (1987) noted that the resulting "grammar" produced when using social groups as a unit of analysis is a sort of "'average' grammar representative of no one speaker" (184)
      % Lightfoot (1999), likewise, distinguished between "grammars", which are "biological entities represented in individual mind/brains" versus "languages", which are "the aggregate output of some set of grammars" (77)
        % More specifically, he proposed social grammars as a corpus of sentences belonging to some socially or politically defined entity (Lightfoot 1999:97)
        % In either case, he did not consider "languages" to be cohesive systems as the grammars of individuals are (Lightfoot 1999:79/81)
    % Baugh (2015) was emphatic that AAVE is English (766-767)
    % In the end, as social constructs, as Terracher (1914) noted long ago, a creole becomes its own distinct language when speakers consider it a language (as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:69)

    % Even in studies of bilingualism, there is debate over the degree to which separate "languages" have shared versus distinct grammars
      % A bivalent word is one which is ambiguously part of either of the two langauges to which its bilingual user has access (Woolard 1999, as cited in Bell 2014:119)
        % This sort of ambiguity gives rise to the question
      % This goes back at least to Swadesh's (1941) claim that a bilingual's identical sounds all belong to a single system, so that where the two languages have an identical sound there's simply one mental representation (as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:8)
      % The BIA+ model of language processing argues for shared lexicons (Dijkstra & Van Heuven 2002)
      % Roberts & Siyanova-Chanturia (2013) argued that previous studies have shown that there is one mental lexicon for all languages in a bilingual's mind as words from all languages become activated during reading (221)
      % Altarriba et al. (1996) argued that previous work had shown that bilinguals have multiple lexicons that are all tied to one set of representations (478-479)
      % The input switch theory of language processing argues that bilinguals process language by activating the required language and deactivating the other (Macnamara & Kushnir 1971, as cited in Spivey & Marian 1999:281)
        % This was not supported by Spivey & Marian's (1999) experiment with Russian-English bilinguals (283)

    There are quite a few structural similarities between French and Creole in Louisiana.
    It has been said that ``[Louisiana Creole] is probably the French-based Creole that is closest to French structurally'' \parencite[p.~111]{valdman_structure_1997}, particularly so in Lafayette, Breaux Bridge, and Vacherie \parencite[p.~78]{klingler_language_2003}, the first two being municipalities of interest in the present study.
    Lexically, the two varieties are generally found to be almost identical, leaving differences to be found primarily in the area of morphosyntax (\citeauthor{clifton_tracing_1975}, \citeyear[p.~109]{clifton_tracing_1975}; \citeauthor{klingler_probleme_2005}, \citeyear[p.~352]{klingler_probleme_2005}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~52/54]{neumann_creole_1985}).
    Diagnostics proposed for structurally distinguishing between French and Creole have thus following along those lines.
    \textcite{klingler_language_2003} used first person singular subject pronouns (\lexi{mo} vs \lexi{je}), past perfective constructions (long form verbs vs auxiliary + past participle), and the verb \gloss{to have} (\lexi{gain} vs \lexi{avoir}),  the first of each pair being the Creole variant.
    However, even in the realm of subject pronouns, he explained that some such as third person singular (\lexi{li} vs \lexi{il}) would not have been effective as both of these can be reduced to [i] (p.~80), an ambiguity which highlights again how difficult it can be to draw clear structural boundaries between French and Creole.
    In fact, even for \lexi{mo}, forms that are more or less equivalent have been found in regions where no Creole is said to be spoken at all, such as Terrebonne-Lafourche \parencite[p.~179]{rottet_language_1995}.
    \textcite{wendte_chronotopic_2022} used a similar system as a diagnostic but considered all personal subject pronouns, the use of ``particles'' in general to mark tense rather than just one tense-aspect construction, and the use of the verbs \lexi{oler} and \lexi{couru} in addition to \lexi{gain} (p.~98).
    However, in acknowledging that these diagnostics fail at times due to speakers producing contradictory features within even a single clause,\footnote{
      \textcite{tentchoff_speech_1977} had long ago reported this same phenomenon, providing an example of a speaker producing phrases such as ``\textsc{Of course}, j'ai valsé Therese \textsc{around}. Mo \textsc{face} li \textsc{back}'' and ``Mo mené li dessus un char dehors, \textsc{and} uh, il a pris un soupir là'' (p.~76).
      This example displays shifts between the pronouns \lexi{mo} and \lexi{je} and shifts between the expression of perfective past with so-called long form verbs (\lexi{mené}) and auxiliaries with past participles (\lexi{ai valsé} and \lexi{a pris}), both features that \textcite{klingler_language_2003} used as diagnostics.
    } \textcite{klingler_probleme_2005} proposed that a language continuum exists (pp.~360-364).
    Such continuums were themselves originally prosposed to deal with how difficult it can be to draw a line between what is Creole structure and what is lexifier structure in other creole situations \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][]{decamp_toward_1971}, often implicating decreolization processes which themselves suggest a close enough structural relationship that one could hypothesize that a creole would get absorbed back into a lexifier language.
    % Neumann (1985), on the other hand, said that decreolization in morphosyntax and phonology occurred in the direction of Cajun (46)

    Besides ambiguities in which third person singular subject pronouns are being produced, one can easily find many other examples of structural features the blur the line between French and Creole.
    In terms of morphosyntax where the two varieties are thought to be most different, it was found that both French and Creole speakers in St Martin Parish produce a Creole-oriented pattern for negative imperatives when there is an object pronoun (\foreign{i.e.}, verb + \lexi{pas} + pronoun) \parencite[p.~137]{baronian_influence_2005}, and disjunctive pronouns have been attested in post-verbal positions, as is typical in speech said to be Creole (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[p.~40]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~166-167]{neumann_creole_1985}), even when the rest of the clause is clearly French-oriented in structure as in sentence \ref{sent:postverbal_object_pro}.
    Within noun phrases themselves, it has been argued that the most evidence of decreolization can be found, or in other words, that Creole resembles French the most.
    For instance, to express a generic reference in Creole, one would produce a bare noun just as is done in English rather than a noun with a definite article as is done in French, although this is more of a historical pattern that by the 1980s had already been mostly replaced by the use of definite articles with the only distinguishing characteristic being the articles sometimes appearing in a post-nominal position \parencite[pp.~54/77]{neumann_creole_1985}.
    Not limited strictly to noun phrases, whereas French makes heavy use of grammatical gender, this feature has typically been described as only existing consistently in Creole when there are semantic backs (\foreign{e.g.}, \lexi{cousin} \gloss{cousin-masculine} vs \lexi{cousine} \gloss{cousin-feminine}) \parencite[p.~170]{klingler_if_2003}.
    However, in Terrebonne-Lafourche where Creole is not spoken, it was reported that gender is not always expressed in adjectives \parencite[p.~89]{papen_structural_1997}, whereas in the Creole of St Martin Parish, grammatical gender has been attested in adjectives, both definite and indefinite articles as well as pre- and post-nominal articles, possessive determiners, and pronouns \parencite[pp.~58-59]{neumann_creole_1985}.
    While some speech may appear prototypically French or prototypically Creole, there are numerous examples of structural convergence.
    % St Martin contains Breaux Bridge, noted by Klingler (2003 "Language") as being a town where French and Creole are in great contact
    % Baronian (2005) wasn't clear on how he distinguished between French and Creole, but did give examples, and those examples were identical save for the use of mo and gain in Creole speech (135), much like what Klingler (2003 "Language", 2005) did
    
    \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
      \item s'il a pu rencontrer \emph{elle} \label{sent:postverbal_object_pro} \parencite[p.~146]{conwell_louisiana_1963}
    \end{enumerate}

    A notoriously common structural feature of creoles is the presence of what have been called preverbal markers that express tense, mood, and aspect (TMA) \parencite{winford_creole_2018}, and Louisiana Creole is no exception.
    In fact, referring to these units as markers or even particles is something of an admission that the lexical categories to which they belong have not been well elaborated as neither markers nor particles are syntactically well defined in linguistics.
    Some creole-centric attempts to establish definitions have been made \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][pp.~210/221-223]{valdman_creole_1978}, but these constitute an exceptionalist approach to creoles that would maintain that creoles and creoles alone employ a unique lexical category.
    Indeed, in generative analyses of markers, the question of the lexical categories of markers is generally not taken up but rather left vague \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][]{syea_tense_2006}.
    In French-lexifier creoles, this is true despite some relatively transparent relationships with morphemes in the lexifier.
    \textcite{aboh_null_2017} argued for a genetic relationship between French and Haitian Creole at least in part on the number of preverbal markers that ``have straightforward etyma in French morphemes in periphrastic verbal constructions whose meanings often overlap with those of the corresponding TMA+V combinations in'' Haitian Creole (p.~410).
    % Aboh & deGraff (2017) discuss te, ap, the verbal suffix -e, future a(va), fini, sòt, and dwe (409-410)
      % Detges (2000) also cites uses of être après reported by Pomier (1835) (152)
      % Detges (2000) links the Mauritian Creole future marker pou to the use of être pour to express the near future in 1880 French (145)

    Many of the markers of Louisiana Creole can likewise be interpreted as more or less still corresponding semantically and functionally with their French correlates despite the morphosyntax of markers being where researchers have suggested that French and Creole differ the most (\citeauthor{clifton_tracing_1975}, \citeyear[p.~109]{clifton_tracing_1975}; \citeauthor{klingler_probleme_2005}, \citeyear[p.~352]{klingler_probleme_2005}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~52/54]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{wendte_chronotopic_2022}, \citeyear[p.~98]{wendte_chronotopic_2022}).
    Table \ref{tab:creole_markers} presents an overview of these correspondences.
    One example from the table, the marker [te] has been described as representing not just past tense, in fact, but also imperfective aspect both in Pointe Coupée and St Martin (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~253-254]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~61]{neumann_creole_1985}), a dual function that already draws it farther from the neat division between tense markers and aspect markers that TMA discussion in creoles elaborate and closer to French \lexi{était}, pronounced [ete] or [etɛ], and other homophonous past imperfective inflections of the verb \lexi{être} \gloss{to be} that serve as its likely origin.
    The elision of the initial [e] is also common for many speakers in Louisiana whose speech is otherwise quite French-oriented.
    Among my own participants, there were such tokens as \sent{c'était} as [s te], \sent{j'étais} as [ʃ te], and even \sent{il était} as [i te].
    Some speakers also produced [ʃy te], which can certainly be analyzed as \sent{je suistais}, or in other words a variant inflection of \sent{j'étais} after several phonological rules have applied, but it is also not out of the question that these speakers simply have [te] in their lexicons as a past imperfective element, which could be represented in an analysis as something like \sent{je suis [te]}.
    Furthermore, where Creole-oriented speakers might produce a phrase such as sentence \ref{sent:mo_te} with a [te] before a non-finite verb, French-oriented speakers similarly produced phrases such as sentence \ref{sent:je_te}, suggesting an auxiliary verb status for [te] in both cases.
    A detailed discussion of all the correspondances relevant to the current study will take place in section \ref{sec:preverbal_markers} to justify how they were coded in the data.
    The goal for this study is not to establish beyond any doubt the status of preverbal markers as French or Creole but rather to demonstrate that a strong case can be made for their structural congruencies with French morphemes, justifying aggregating the two varieties as F\&C.

    \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
      \item {}[mo te travaje] \label{sent:mo_te}
      \item[] \gloss{I would work}
      \item {}[ʃ te pe travaje] \label{sent:je_te}
      \item[] \gloss{I was working}
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Spelling conventions for the present study}
      \label{sec:spelling}
      Before moving on to an overview of the subject pronoun system of F\&C, a few notes must be made on the spelling used in this study.
      Just as French and Creole are being aggregated here purely to facilitate analyses rather than to take a sociopolitical stance on the status of these varieties as independent languages, my orthographic choices are a matter of easing comparisons only.
      On a sociopolitical level, similarities in structure between French and Creole can be obscured via choices in how to represent Creole orthographically.
      Distinguishing Creole from French was in fact a primary goal in the development of the most current general-use orthography that has been proposed (\citeauthor{landry_kouri-vini_2016}, \citeyear{landry_kouri-vini_2016}; \citeauthor{mayeux_language_2024}, \citeyear[p.~13]{mayeux_language_2024}).
      Representing Creole-oriented speech and French-oriented speech differently would work against the goal here, which is quite the opposite of \citeauthor{landry_kouri-vini_2016}'s (\citeyear{landry_kouri-vini_2016}) goal.
      Using two orthographies would perhaps be more teneble if one could draw clear lines between when French was being used and when Creole was being used, but as discussed in section \ref{sec:french_vs_creole}, that line is often blurred and indeed was blurred in the speech of my participants.
      
      When quoted in this study, all speech has therefore been rendered through the adaptation of standard French orthography rather than through \citeauthor{landry_kouri-vini_2016}'s (\citeyear{landry_kouri-vini_2016}) system.
      The major reason for this choice over the alternative of using the latter system to represent all quoted speech is that the latter has not yet become widespread enough.
      For instance, a study of attitudes towards how Creole should be written relied on finding participants through Facebook groups as this was considered the population that was ``likely to have an opinion on the subject of Louisiana Creole writing'' \parencite[p.~27]{wendte_identity_2019} despite the researcher having been engaged in extensive face-to-face fieldwork with Creole speakers at the time \parencite{wendte_tale_2020}, presumably meaning that the general population of speakers who are not part of these Facebook groups would likely not have opinions on written Creole.
      The implication is that the creolophones in Louisiana are generally not literate, a likely scenario given the discussion in section \ref{sec:domain_indicators}, or they have not been exposed to proposed standardized orthographies for Creole.
      Thus, regardless of the utility of \citeauthor{landry_kouri-vini_2016}'s (\citeyear{landry_kouri-vini_2016}) system for educational purposes and revitalization purposes, when writing for a broad audience of scholars, there is no comparison with the reach of French orthography.
      
      In practice, there are not a large number of spelling adaptations that need to be made.
      Initial and final segments that would be present in Standard French cognates are sometimes absent, both in Creole-oriented and French-oriented speech (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~168/245]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[pp.~75/77]{papen_structural_1997}).
      In the most noticeable cases, these are replaced by an apostrophe.
      Where speakers produced unrounded front vowels that would typically be rounded in their related French forms, a common feature for Creole speakers \parencite[p.~143]{klingler_if_2003}, the French spelling is used.
      For instance, where French [y] is pronounced as [i], it is written as \orth{u} (\foreign{e.g.}, \orth{couru} instead of \orth{couri}), and likewise where French [ø] is pronounced [e] (\foreign{e.g.}, \orth{deux} instead of \orth{dé}).
      Possessive determiners that are pronounced with [o] rather than French [ɔ̃] are still spelled with a final \orth{n} that is normally present to indicate nasalization (\foreign{e.g.}, \orth{ton} instead of \orth{to}).
      This is simply more readible for the target audience and not critical to any analyses.
      Slightly more relevant to analyses is the preposition \lexi{après} in progressive constructions where it is shortened relative to how it is pronounced in each case, which most often means that no \orth{r} is written.
      Any verb preceded by a ``marker'' is assumed to be an infinitive and thus endings such as [e] are written as \orth{er}, and so on, as would be done in French orthography.
      Verb endings are otherwise written as inflected based on the assumed tense and aspect being used.
      This means that other tokens of verbs that end in, for instance, [e] are transcribed as \orth{ait} or one of the other past imperfective inflections or \orth{é} for past perfective to align with French past participles.
      Likewise, markers that are interpreted here as auxiliary verbs or modal verbs are given written inflections to agree with their subjects, yielding representations such as \orth{peux} or \orth{peut} when [pe] is produced.
      Finally and rarely, the copula when produced as [je] is written as one of the related French present tense inflections of \lexi{être}.
          
      Again, the purpose of the spelling conventions used in this study is to render structural similarities between French and Creole clear and to ease reading for an audience which may be familiar with French orthography but almost certainly not with \citeauthor{landry_kouri-vini_2016}'s (\citeyear{landry_kouri-vini_2016}) general-use orthography.
      These choices are not meant to have any implications beyond that.
      To the extent that the creolophone community of Louisiana wishes to use one orthography or another for themselves, I am in support of their self-determination on that matter.
      % It has been argued for British Creole that non-standard spelling functions both as a way to represent a language that has no orthographic standard as well as a way to distance itself from its superstrate when words could be spelled the same but aren't, such as <Jameka> or <kool> (Sebba 1998, as cited in Androutsopoulos 2000:515)
      % Bengali and Hindi speakers who mix English into their online writing in the former languages sometimes write the former languages using the Roman script for convenience (Barman et al. 2014:13)
        % Likewise, writing here using French orthographic conventions is not a stance on the primacy of French but rather a matter of convenience

    The range of possible subject pronouns in F\&C is particularly wide for practically all feature combinations.
    The attested pronouns summarized in Table \ref{tab:pronouns_attested} come from various times and places that include New Orleans \parencite[p.~107]{fortier_french_1884} and Terrebonne-Lafourche parishes (\citeauthor{carmichael_language_2019}, \citeyear[p.~72]{carmichael_language_2019}; \citeauthor{dajko_ethnic_2009}, \citeyear[pp.~144/160]{dajko_ethnic_2009}; \citeauthor{gudmestad_variationist_2022}, \citeyear{gudmestad_variationist_2022}; \citeauthor{oukada_louisiana_1977}, \citeyear[p.~185]{oukada_louisiana_1977}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~83]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[pp.~175/178/193/197/207]{rottet_language_1995}) but perhaps more importantly Lafayette (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[pp.~141-145]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[pp.~42-58]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}), St Martin Parish (\citeauthor{broussard_louisiana_1972}, \citeyear[p.~8]{broussard_louisiana_1972}; \citeauthor{lane_notes_1934}, \citeyear[p.~328]{lane_notes_1934}; \citeauthor{mayeux_racial_2024}, \citeyear{mayeux_racial_2024}; \citeauthor{morgan_structural_1959}, \citeyear[p.~24c]{morgan_structural_1959}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~166-179]{neumann_creole_1985}), Evangeline Parish (\citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~42-43]{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~218-219]{phillips_spoken_1939}), Vermilion and St Landry parishes \parencite[p.~5]{girard_lomheim_systeme_2019}, Pointe Coupée Parish \parencite[pp.~206/213]{klingler_if_2003}, Avoyelles Parish \parencite[pp.~31-33]{chaudoir_study_1938}, Avoyelles and Assumption parishes \parencite[pp.~152-153]{brown_pronominal_1988}, and broadly from across South Louisiana (\citeauthor{byers_defining_1988}, \citeyear{byers_defining_1988}; \citeauthor{johnson_louisiana_1976}, \citeyear[p.~31]{johnson_louisiana_1976}).
    Some of these studies focused on French-oriented speech and others Creole-oriented speech, but they have all been aggregated here.
    The result demonstrates that there is ample space for sociolinguistic variation in the pronoun paradigm, including the potential for pronoun choices to mark speakers as members of racialized groups.

    The table presents the subject pronouns in the standard orthographic representations of some presumed morphemic forms, but it is important to note that there are considerable phonological questions to address in order to establish these forms satisfactorily.
    One example involves forms used exclusively for first person singular reference that are left mostly divided in the table despite phonetic similarities: [mo], [mwa], [mɔ̃], and [mwɛ̃].
    These have generally been described as subject pronouns used in Creole, but two have been attested in Terrebonne-Lafourche (\citeauthor{gudmestad_variationist_2022}, \citeyear[p.~11]{gudmestad_variationist_2022}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~178]{rottet_language_1995}) and Vermilion Parish (BRANDON 1955) where they are given as \orth{mon} or \orth{moi}, presumably the [mɔ̃] and [mwa] realizations, respectively, rather than the typically attested [mo] or [mwɛ̃] realizations attested in Creole studies.
    None of these latter parishes have been noted for having creolophone residents, diminishing the possibility for influence between speech varieties despite the resemblances.
    Indeed, progressive nasalization as a general phonological process has been noted as a distinguishing trait of Creole \parencite[p.~53]{neumann_creole_1985}, which could render [mo] as [mɔ̃] at times.
    From the opposite direction, [mɔ̃] or [mwa] has been documented as reducing to [m] before vowels in the speech of francophones \parencite[p.~178]{rottet_language_1995}, just as is typical in Creole (\citeauthor{broussard_louisiana_1972}, \citeyear[p.~8]{broussard_louisiana_1972}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~209-210]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~95-96]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[p.~43]{phillips_etude_1936}).
    In Terrebonne-Lafourche where \lexi{je} can be pronounced as [h], this raises the possibility that speakers are actually producing a variant of \lexi{moi} followed by a barely audible [h] rather than simply \lexi{moi} by itself.
    Given that voiceless fricatives are likely less audible than voiced fricatives \parencite[p.~117]{maniwa_perception_2008}, such a result would not be surprising.
    This admittedly would not change how listeners perceive such speakers in that if listeners do not hear the [h], then sociolinguistically, the pronoun is \foreign{de facto} [mɔ̃]/[mwa].
    Alternatively, in St Landry Parish where French and Creole are in heavy contact, \lexi{moi} without \lexi{je} was also attested in what was otherwise characterized as French speech \parencite{dubois_attrition_2001}.
    It is more difficult to rule out the influence of Creole in this last case, meaning it is also more difficult to rule out whether each phonetic variant is socially interpreted differently without conducting a variationist study of them or at least a perceptual study to determine if [mo] and [mɔ̃]/[mwa] are distinguished for listeners.
    Such issues again suggest that French and Creole are not terribly distinct structurally, as discussed in section \ref{sec:french_vs_creole}, and also raise concerns about how to code pronoun tokens for quantitative analyses.
    In this particular case, only one token was produced in a context that could be considered distinctly non-Creole (\foreign{i.e.}, before the verb \lexi{avoir}), and no tokens of the more distinct forms [mwa] or [mwɛ̃] were produced, so the decision on how to code these cases was not critical.
    For other forms, however, such ambiguities in what could be considered phonetic variants of a single target pronoun versus separate pronouns were important to disentangle.
    Those coding decisions will be discussed in detail in section \ref{sec:phonetic_variants}.
    % Among Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche, moi for 1sg was more likely before a vowel (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:18)
    % 1sg as [h] among Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche more frequent before vowels (Rottet 1996, as cited in Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:5)
    % Elision of the vowel in mo is possible before consonants as long as not preceded by another consonant (Klingler 2003 "Turn":210)
    % In the early 20th century, moi je was more common that je by itself in Evangeline Parish, presumably because Creole was in close contact with "Cajun" at that time (Phillips 1936, as cited in Rottet 1995:181)

    %%%%% Probably move to methods sections %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Some unique uses of One of the first features can be noted about them such as the use of \lexi{on}.
    % This pronoun is found across the French-speaking world to refer to both first person plural subjects and impersonal subjects.
    % For the former, the alternative often preferred in formal contexts is \lexi{nous}, but in French-oriented speech in Louisiana, \lexi{nous} has been described as anywhere from nearly absent \parencite[p.~142]{conwell_louisiana_1963} to completely absent (\citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~82]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~173]{rottet_language_1995}).
    % However, in Creole-oriented speech, what is often a homophone of \lexi{nous} [nu(z)] has in fact been attested as \orth{nou} [nu].
    % For this study, these are treated as distinct pronouns for reasons that will be enumerated in section \ref{sec:pronoun_coding}.
    % On the other hand, the use of \lexi{on} as an impersonal pronoun in Louisiana has been considered rare, either \lexi{tu}, \lexi{vous}, or a third personal plural pronoun taking up this function (\citeauthor{lane_notes_1934}, \citeyear[p.~238]{lane_notes_1934}; \citeauthor[Guilbeau, 1950, as cited in][]{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~88]{papen_structural_1997}), to non-existent \parencite[p.~173]{rottet_language_1995}.
    % Finally, extremely rare and rather unique to Louisiana, the use of \lexi{on} for first person singular has been attested one time, as well (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~142]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[pp.~53-54]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
    % However, this usage is questionable.
    % \textcite{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, for example, gives the example in sentence \ref{sent:on_1sg}, parsing the last clause as \gloss{I will dance a waltz with you} rather than \gloss{we will dance will dance a waltz with you} because it is a conversation between two individuals, discounting the possibility that the speaker could be suggesting that everyone will dance with the addressee.
    % % On is used by White creolophones but not so much by other creolophones (Neumann 1985:173)

    % \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
    %   \item {}[i] dit, ``Si tu gagnes l'élection,'' [i] dit ``on va danser une valse avec toi.'' \parencite[p.~54]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} \label{sent:on_1sg}
    % \end{enumerate}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    On the other end of the spectrum is the case of a pronoun form \lexi{ça}, which appears in many places in the paradigm in Table \ref{tab:pronouns_attested}, a behavior that makes it stand apart from what one expects from how it is used in standard Hexagonal French.
    This pronoun is indeed common in other French-related varieties but typically only as a demonstrative pronoun replacing \lexi{cela} or \lexi{ceci} in casual speech.
    However, not only are the latter two pronouns thought to be absent in Louisiana (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~124]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[pp.~48-49]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}), but \lexi{ça} goes beyond its use as a demonstrative in F\&C to be a typical expletive pronoun (\foreign{e.g.}, \sent{ça mouille} \gloss{it rains}) as well as something of a pseudo-expletive pronoun with a wide scope.
    In other words, when \lexi{ça} appears as a second person plural pronoun, for instance, it gets its reference from a co-occurring disjunctive pronoun, in this case \lexi{vous-autres}, as in sentence \ref{sent:vous-autres_ca}.
    Likewise, as in sentence \ref{sent:eux-autres_ca}, \lexi{eux} and \lexi{eux-autres} when used as disjunctive pronouns have been attested as giving \lexi{ça} third person plural reference that can also be an animate referent.
    Such uses of \lexi{ça} are not unheard of in other French-related varieties \parencite[pp.~462-463]{grevisse_bon_1964}, but \lexi{ça} as a regular third person plural pronoun in particular has become far more regularized in Louisiana, not requiring a co-referring expression to be present at all, suggesting that it has become a full personal pronoun for third person plural.

    \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
      \item vous-autres, \textbf{ça} va à l'école\footnote{
        Other examples provided by \textcite{conwell_louisiana_1963} are less convincing. For instance, ``vous-autres, ça donnent bien'' \gloss{y'all, you give well} was likely the homophonous \sent{vous-autres s'adonne bien} \gloss{y'all get along well}.
      } \parencite[p.~143]{conwell_louisiana_1963} \label{sent:vous-autres_ca}
      \item[] y'all, \textbf{you} go to school
      \item eux-autres, \textbf{ça} connaissait pas \parencite[p.~60]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} \label{sent:eux-autres_ca}
      \item[] them, \textbf{they} didn't know
    \end{enumerate}

    When used as a third person plural personal pronoun, \lexi{ça} has not been attested as marking gender, but this is not unique to \lexi{ça}.
    In fact, regardless of the morpheme used for third person plural, gender is unmarked, be it \lexi{ça}, \lexi{eux}, \lexi{yé}, or even \lexi{ils} (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~144]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~84]{papen_structural_1997}).
    The presence of the form \lexi{elles}, marked as exclusiely feminine in most varieties, would help establish a gender marking for the other third person plural pronouns but is typically reported as being absent in the speech of Louisianians (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{chaudoir_study_1938}, \citeyear[p.~33]{chaudoir_study_1938}; \citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~145]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{girard_lomheim_systeme_2019}, \citeyear[p.~5]{girard_lomheim_systeme_2019}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~84]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[p.~43]{phillips_etude_1936}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~47]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
    Likewise, third person singular pronouns have been reported as lacking gender distinctions.
    For Creole, researchers have emphasized a genderless \lexi{li}, although most have also acknowledged that some speakers do have a feminine form in \lexi{elle}, leaving the former for masculine (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~170/209]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{mayeux_rethinking_2019}, \citeyear[p.~115]{mayeux_rethinking_2019}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~170]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[p.~43]{phillips_etude_1936}).
    For French, the situation is reversed.
    Whereas the expectation is to find masculine \lexi{il} in back with feminine \lexi{elle} both in Hexagonal French and Louisiana French (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~144]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~47]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}), some Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche use \lexi{il} for both masculine and feminine (\citeauthor{dajko_ethnic_2009}, \citeyear[p.~160]{dajko_ethnic_2009}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~128]{rottet_language_1995}).
    In effect, grammatical gender is quite a bit more backgrounded in the subject pronouns of F\&C than what can be found in other Hexagonal French.
    % Ça was attested for singular animate referents of both genders in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Oukada 1977:197)
    % Outside Louisiana
      % In Montreal, when referring to a group of exclusively women, ils is used in casual speech whereas elles is reserved for careful speech in formal contexts (G. Sankoff 2015:42)

    Animacy in F\&C subject pronouns, likewise, has not always been found to follow the same patterns as Hexagonal French.
    In the literature, this feature is typically only discussed as it relates to the aforementioned use of \lexi{ça} for animate referents, present in every discussion of French-oriented speech in Louisiana and even as a rare occurence in Creole-oriented speech \parencite[p.~208]{klingler_if_2003}.
    However, a lack of inanimate use of \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle} pronoun usage is also notable.\footnote{
      On the contrary, \lexi{li} has been attested for both animate and inanimate referents in Creole-oriented speech \parencite{klingler_if_2003}.
    }
    Unlike in English, many if not most French varieties allow these pronouns to reference inanimate objects in cases where English would use \lexi{it} despite glossing literally as \gloss{he} and \gloss{she}, respectively.
    In Louisiana, this appears to be either rare or to have changed over the last 60 years or so.
    \textcite{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} reported the \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle} were used in Lafayette for inanimate referents but unfortunately only provided examples of animate uses (pp.~47-48).
    \textcite{conwell_louisiana_1963}, on the other hand, described inanimate \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle} as the default, explaining that ``[p]ronouns referring to inanimate objects are sometimes replaced by \lexi{ce}'' (p.~145) as in \sent{c'est} rather than \sent{il/elle est}.
    Again, unfortunately, only examples of this replacement were provided rather than examples of inanimate \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle}, making it unclear how often the latter two were truly used for inanimate objects.
    The point is important not because these researchers are not to be trusted but because the corpus for this study includes only \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[(tokens$ProType == "3sg.IM" & tokens$ProUnder == "il") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.I" & tokens$ProUnder == "il") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.I" & tokens$ProUnder == "elle") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.IF" & tokens$ProUnder == "elle"),])} such tokens, \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[(tokens$ProType == "3sg.IM" & tokens$ProUnder == "il") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.I" & tokens$ProUnder == "il") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.I" & tokens$ProUnder == "elle") | (tokens$ProType == "3sg.IF" & tokens$ProUnder == "elle") & tokens$Name == "Samantha Primeaux",])} of those coming from a participant whose language was the product of immersion schooling, all other tokens being \lexi{ça} for speakers who use \lexi{il} or \lexi{elle} for animate referents.
    Indeed, although she described it as ``a neutral pronoun meaning `it','' \textcite[pp.~48-49]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} seemed to have been acknowledging that \lexi{ça} is the typical pronoun for either expletive or third person singular inanimate uses.
    The result of this are animacy-gender paradigms as shown in Tables \ref{tab:animacy_gender_sf}, \ref{tab:animacy_gender_lf}, and \ref{tab:animacy_gender_hif} where third person singular pronouns are distinguished along the lines of animacy in Louisiana as opposed to being distinguished along the lines of gender as in France.

    Analyses of other referential constraints on subject pronoun choice in F\&C have been very sparse with one exception being \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} who looked only at \lexi{ça}.
    \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} considered not only types of referents (p.~168) but also the syntactic positions of co-referential expressions as either cataphoric, anaphoric, or exophoric (p.~179).
    The latter was not found to predict pronoun realization, but the former did.
    The types of referents she looked at were propositions, concrete referents, abstract referents, and animate referents.
    Propositions led to greater use of \lexi{ça} whereas animate referents led to less use of \lexi{ça} with the others somewhere in between.
    \citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}'s (\citeyear{brown_pronominal_1988}) analysis is somewhat muddied by the fact that she aggregated not just \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle} but also \lexi{ils}.
    Nevertheless, the results are not particularly surprising and support the preceding discussion in that \lexi{ça} is the pronoun of choice for inanimate referents in whatever form those referents take.

    A final structural predictor of subject pronoun realization that has been considered several times in the literature is the following verb.
    \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} also looked at this in her analysis, finding that \lexi{ça} was preferred before intransitive verbs, slightly dispreferred before transitive verbs, and dispreferred before modal verbs (pp.~173-174).
    This result is once again difficult to disentangle because of the conflation of \lexi{il} and \lexi{elle} with \lexi{ils} as the alternative pronoun realization but also because she sometimes interpreted the verb \lexi{être} \gloss{to be} as intransitive.
    The verb \lexi{être} is thus grouped with verbs such as \lexi{dormir} \gloss{to sleep} or perhaps \lexi{rester} \gloss{to stay}/\gloss{to live} without acknowledging that it may behave quite differently as a copula.
    On the other hand, \textcite{byers_defining_1988} compared the distribution of \lexi{ça} versus \lexi{ils} for third person plural relative to the following verb without abstracting to verb type.
    His results suggested that \lexi{ça} was preferred before \lexi{être}, \lexi{avoir} \gloss{to have}, and \lexi{aller} \gloss{to go}, whereas \lexi{ils} was preferred with all other verbs (p.~49).
    The common thread between these three verbs is that they are all auxiliary verbs, but importantly they distinct from other auxiliary verbs in not always being modal as is the case with auxiliaries such as \lexi{pouvoir} \gloss{to be able to} and \lexi{devoir} \gloss{to have to}.

    The following verb has also been found to be associated with realizations of first person singular pronouns.
    In Lafourche Parish, a null pronoun for first person singular was reported as being most frequent before reflexive verbs yielding constructions such as \sent{ø me rappelle} \gloss{I remember} and \sent{ø me doute} \gloss{I suspect} \parencite[Guilbeau, 1950, as cited in][p.~183]{rottet_language_1995}.
    It is notable that the reflexive pronouns used in such verbal constructions (\foreign{e.g.}, \lexi{me}) provide clues for the subject of the verb.
    This is especially true for first person singular.
    A reflexive pronoun such as \lexi{se} may point back to third person singular or third person plural with no distinction for the intended gender or animacy of the subject.
    In Louisiana, it may even point back to second person plural as in sentence \ref{sent:reflexive_vous-autres}.
    Howevever, for first person singular, only \lexi{me} is possible -- or \lexi{mo-même} in the speech of those with post-verbal object pronouns \parencite[p.~212]{klingler_if_2003} -- therefore removing the need for an explicit subject pronoun to make the subject clear.

    \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
      \item Faut que \emph{vous-autres se} couche de bonne heure. \label{sent:reflexive_vous-autres} \parencite[p.~85]{papen_structural_1997}
      \item[] \gloss{It's necessary that you all put yourselves to bed early.}
    \end{enumerate}

    Another verbal association for first person singular pronouns was found in St Landry Parish where \lexi{je} alone as well as \lexi{moi je} were found to be associated with verbs expressing beliefs and opinions, whereas \lexi{moi} by itself was associated with the verb \lexi{être} and ``verbes réguliers''\footnote{
      Literally, \gloss{regular verbs}, by which \textcite{dubois_attrition_2001} seemed to mean lexical verbs.
    } \parencite[p.~160]{dubois_attrition_2001}.
    This combination of the disjunctive pronoun \lexi{moi} with the clitic pronoun \lexi{je} as a distinct variant has been used before in analyses.
    Typical in French varieties around the world, disjunctive pronouns such as \lexi{moi} would be added to either for emphasis since French clitics cannot be stressed or to highlight a back (\foreign{e.g.}, \sent{he thinks this, but I think differently, me}).
    \textcite{rottet_language_1995} justified the choice of treating \lexi{moi je} as a normal, non-discursive variant by arguing that some passages of conversation with his participants contain more tokens of \lexi{moi je} together than \lexi{je} alone, leading him to conclude that ``it would be very strange indeed if emphatic contexts outnumbered nonemphatic ones in `normal' conversation'' (pp.~178-179).
    \lexi{Moi je} is not, however, included in the present analyses as a pronoun variant because the example used, reproduced in sentence \ref{sent:moi_je} below, can in fact be interpreted as backive instances of \lexi{moi} as the speaker is backing their own knowledge of prayers in French with what other people might know.
    With all due respect for the decisions previous researchers have taken, my own position is that there is not enough evidence to motivate treating disjunctive-clitic pronoun combinations are distinct variants aggregated with other lone clitic pronouns in opposition with how disjunctive-clitic pronouns have been understood in standard French varieties.
    Rather, disjunctive pronouns function as discursive tools when coordinated with clitic pronouns, discourse being a subject that will be briefly reviewed in the next section.

    \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
      \item \label{sent:moi_je} KR: Et t'as appris les prières en français ou anglais?
      \item[] \gloss{And you learned your prayers in French or English?}
      \item[] I28: \textbf{Mon s}'a 'pris les prières en anglais, mais s'connais le Salut Marie, le \codeEn{HAIL MARY}, en français. Là \textbf{mon s}'connais. Mémère m'a montré. ø veux apprendre les autes, mais c'est pour m'assir là, aller dire que mon ø vas lé apprendre, mais ça c'est le seul qui \textbf{mon s}'connais.
      \item[] \gloss{I [back] learned the prayers in English, but I know the Hail Mary, the \codeEn{HAIL MARY}, in French. That, I [back] know. Grandma taught me. I want to learn the others, but I have to sit there, go say that I'm going to learn them, but that's the only one I [back] know.}
    \end{enumerate}

    Finally, \textcite{gudmestad_variationist_2022} also found the following verb to constraint which phonetic variants of first person singular \lexi{je} were produced, [ʃ] being favored before verbs of the \lexi{-er} class, [ʒ] being disfavored, and [h] and ø forming the baseline (pp.~14-15).
    \textcite{gudmestad_variationist_2022} importantly only analyzed the speech of Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche, which highlights the potential for differing variation systems for other groups in Louisiana.
    Indeed, the literature on subject pronouns in F\&C has been primarily aimed at elaborating descriptive grammars rather than sociolinguistic analyses.
    These studies do, however, include useful sociolinguistic observations at times.
    These observations and comparing the results of studies that have been conducted allow some tentative conclusions about social variation to be drawn, which will be discussed in the next section.

  \section{F\&C subject pronouns and their social variation}
    \label{sec:pronoun_social}
  % Social variation
    % Discourse
      % Among Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche, moi for 1sg was more likely if the referent had changed (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:18)
      % 1sg as [h] among Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche more frequent and [z] less frequent in casual speech (Dajko 2009, as cited in Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:5)
      % T-V distinction
        % T-V distinctions have been studied at least since R. Brown & Gilman (1960) who suggested that the was based on the power hierarchy between the two interlocutors (the nonreciprocal power semantic) and the intimacy vs formality of a relationship (the solidarity semantic)
          % Schoch (1978) analyzed T-V distinctions specifically in French in Lausanne in terms of age and social class
        % Variants used for V
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, tu is used in addition to vous (Rottet 1995:197)
          % Conwell & Juilland (1963) claimed that you could identify vous (sg) vs vous (pl) because the former would entail singular verbal inflections (143)
            % Phillips (1936), on the other hand, claimed that vous was only ever used in the singular "pour témoigner le respect," even giving an -ez ending as an example in vous allez (42)
            % Likewise, Chaudoir (1938) gave vous only for singular polite (32)
        % Who gets V'd?
          % In Pointe Coupee, Klingler (2003 "Turn") suggests that a V form is used with older people but also possibly women and Blacks addressing Whites (208)
            % Tentchoff (1977) 
          % Mayeux (2024) described "vu" as a form used by children towards adults normally (35)
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, elderly participants variably claimed to have tutoi'd there parents or vouvoi'd them (Rottet 1995:186)
          % One of Rottet's (1995) participants explained that they usually use toi but that their mother tells them to use vous with "older people or somebody important" (165)
          % Rottet's (1995) own T-V (mis)use was pointed out by some of his participants, one elderly woman who told him vous was the appropriate term when he slipped into tu, and some others who asked him to use tu instead of vous because vous made them feel old (198)
          % Vous is generally used with "much older interlocutor[s]" or when showing "special respect to a stranger, particularly when the stranger is female" in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:82/84)
    % Gender
      % Among Indians in Terrbonne-Lafourche, for 1sg, males disfavored [h] but were neutral between null, [ʃ], and [ʒ] (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:14-15)
    % Age
      % Ça (vs ils+il+elle) was slighty dispreferred for those over 50 and slighty preferred by those under 50 in Avoyelles and Assumption (B. Brown 1988:178)
      % Younger speakers who used only ça and eux in Terrebonne-Lafourche used the former for inanaminate referents and the latter for animate (Rottet 1995:219)
        % Though the use of ça increased for all age groups from for inanimate objects from 15% to 50% (Rottet 1995:209-210)
          % Recheck what he means by this since he didn't do a study of change in real time
    % Fluency
      % Semi-speakers in Terrebonne-Lafourche used a much wider variety of phonetic variants of je than young and old fluent speakers (Carmichael & Gudmestad 2019:79)
      % Among Indian in Terrebonne-Lafourche, moi with 1sg was more likely to be produced by semispeakers (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:18)
      % Among Indians in Terrbonne-Lafourche, for 1sg, semispeakers disfavored [h] but were neutral between null, [ʃ], and [ʒ] (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:14-15)
      % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Rottet (1995) suggested that imperfect speakers leaned towards disjunctive pronouns in place of clitic pronouns for two reasons: 1) disjunctive pronouns are more sallient and so easier to pick up with limited input, and 2) English doesn't have clitic pronouns so disjunctive pronouns in French are simpler to acquire when growing up bilingual (180)
    % Region
      % In Lafayette, ça was most common but ils, eux, and eux-autres also occurred (J. S. Smith 1994:58)
      % J. S. Smith (1994) also found ils -ont in Lafayette (66-67)
      % Ça or eux-autres ça are preferred in Evangeline (Phillips 1936:43)
      % Byers (1988) did not find ils _-ont in Lafourche as he expected to (49)
      % Ça (vs ils+il+elle) was slighty dispreferred in Assumption Parish and slighty preferred in Avoyelles (B. Brown 1988:176)
        % B. Brown (1988) suggested that Avoyelles was in heavier contact with English, which she believed to not have clitic pronouns, and so reasoned that the preference for ça (a non-clitic to her) was due to greater English influence (177-178)
          % She makes a decent case that Avoyelles is less isolated, but it's a leap from there to her other conclusions
          % Is ça not a clitic? I would say it is for Louisianians, especially when it's realized as c'
          % While we know that English has influenced French in the area, this is perhaps the only study where it has been suggested to have influenced subject pronouns which are usually discussed as having internal influences related to language acquisition
      % Almost all of the variants marked as Creole (by Klingler, 1sg subject pronouns, perfective aspect representation, and the verb 'to have') used by speakers in St Landry Parish were produced by 4 speakers from Leonville, Prairie Ville, and Arnaudville (Klingler 2003 "Language":83).
        % These towns are all along Bayou Teche which historically was lined with plantations (Klingler 2003 "Language":83)
        % Most variants were marked as French in general
        % Most Creole variants were also used by Blacks, though not exclusively (some White Cajuns used Creole-marked perfective aspect)
      % Almost all variants of 1sg pronouns, perfective aspect, and the verb 'to have' used by speakers in Pointe Coupee (3 Black, 2 White) were variants marked as Creole save for some tokens (~7%) of 'avoir' used only by Whites (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
        % For 1sg specifically, only 2 tokens were not mo, and those 2 tokens were null rather than je (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
      % Ça as an expletive pronoun was generally used in Pierre Part and Hessmer (B. Brown 1988:125)
      % The rate of [z] for /ʒ/ was much higher in Dulac/Grand Caillou than other nearby towns (Dajko 2009:120)
      % Klingler (2005) found that speakers in Pointe Coupee used Creole-marked variants and in St Landry French-marked variants for 1sg pronouns, past perfective, and the verb 'to have' (354-356)
    % Race / Ethnicity
      % Pronouns
        % Variation in pronoun systems along racial or ethnic lines considered holistically
          % In Pointe Coupee Creole, Whites use pronouns that are closer to French and that agree in gender and/or number (e.g. avèk èl vs avèk li (f.)) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
        % For 1sg, null was the most common for Indian speakers of all levels in Terrebonne-Lafourche, sometimes with moi (i.e., moi by itself was possible) (Gudmestad & Carmichael 2022:11)
        % Indians sometimes depalatalize /ʒ/ so that it becomes [s] before voiceless consonants or vowels and [z] before voiced consonants (Papen & Rottet 1997:82; Rottet 1995:127/176)
          % 1sg as [z] in Terrebonne-Lafourche may be indicative of Indian identity (Dajko 2009:121-122)
      % Not pronouns
        % Several features differ along racial lines in Pointe Coupee Creole
          % Whites tend to pronounce rounded front vowels more often, whereas the rounding is more regularly lost among Blacks (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites tend to pronounce word final and preconsonantal rs more regularly. Whites also use the affricate /tʃ/ in place of /k/ more often (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
            % In Breaux Bridge, Neumann (1985) found something of the opposite in that Whites didn't use the affricates /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ in place of /tj/ and /dj/ as these were considered speaking "nègre" (91)
            % Neumann (1985) did however find the Whites in Breaux Bridge were also the ones to pronounce post-vocalic /r/ more often (95)
          % Whites use gender and number agreement for adjectives and determiners much more often (e.g., se zekla vs so zekla-ye and ma manman vs mo manman and mo (f.) movèz vs mo move) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites use determiners that are closer to French and that agree in gender and/or number (e.g. lœrtchèn vwazinaj vs yekèn vwazinaj and tou le paròl-sa-la vs tou paròl-sa-ye) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites tend to use d(e) to indicate a relation between nouns where blacks will just juxtapose the nouns (e.g. enn mezon-d-ekòl vs enn lamezon-ekòl for schoolhouse) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites sometimes pronounce the past tense marker te and the clause final copula ye as ete and e, respectively (Klingler 2003 "Turn":119)
          % Whites tend to use a stem without the final e (or equivalent) in the habitual present and the 2nd person singular imperative, whereas blacks tend to use one long stem invariably in all contexts (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Irregular verbs like to have, to want, and to can take French-like conjugations in the speech of Whites but less in the speech of Blacks (e.g. nou u vs nou te gen and tou me katen ave vs tou mo katen-ye te gen and cochon-la voule vs cochon-la t'ole and ye peu pa parle vs ye pa kapab pale and mo poura chante vs mo sa kapab chante) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":118)
        % Neumann (1985) looked at Blacks in her study of Breaux Bridge Creole because she claimed that their language was «moins affectés par la "décréolisation"» (2)
          % Neumann (1985) reported that towns where Whites spoke Creole were Henderson, Cecilia, Catahoula, and Kraemer (40)
            % These speakers differed in that they did not used post-nominal yé and did have grammatical gender marked in their determiners (Neumann 1985:41)

    % Lagniappe
      % Origin of non-hexagonal pronoun forms?
        % An argument for the origin of yo in Haitian Creole is the disjunctive pronoun eux (Lefebvre 2001:383-384)
          % One could imagine the same arguments for ye
      % Null subjects are attested Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec for 3sg (LeBlanc 1996, as cited in Carmichael & Gudmestad 2019:83)
      % For il > [i], this is broadly the case for French, such as in Montreal in 1971 where it also applies to impersonal il, feminine elle, and plural ils and elles (G. Sankoff 2015:27)
      % "On" was used far more than nous in Montreal (D. Sankoff & Laberge 1978 "Statistical":120/126)
      % Null subjects are attested Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec for 3pl (LeBlanc 1996, as cited in Carmichael & Gudmestad 2019:83)
      % Qui has been attested as 'what' in Terrebonne-Lafourche, Vermilion, and Avoyelles (Papen & Rottet 1997:105)

    % Potential of some pronouns being disjunctive with a null clitic rather than simply being the subject pronouns themselves
      % Clitics can be defined as not being able to take stress (Cardinaletti & Starke 1999), though even those that appear identical to clitics from Hexagonal French are stressed at times in my data
      % Nous-autres, vous-autres, eux-autres, and eux all occur in other French varieties as disjunctive pronouns
      % Vous-autres usually takes a bare verb but has been attested with 3pl forms like vont in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:97)
        % Notably, -ez is not used
      % Eux-autres and eux take bare verbs except when the verb is être which "frequently" yields sont (Papen & Rottet 1997:97)

  \section{Methods}
    \label{sec:pronoun_methods}
    In the case of Creoles and Cajuns having become racialized categories, a natural question is what traits are used to mark individuals as fitting into these categories.
    The goal of this chapter is to address quantitatively whether subject pronouns constitute one of those traits.
    The speech of the participants discussed in section \ref{sec:participants} make up the data used for the following analyses.
    As their social characteristics have already been summarized in Table \ref{tab:participants_background}, this section will primarily focus on how subject pronoun tokens and the predicates following them were coded and what statistical analyses were carried out.

    \subsection{Pronoun coding}
      \label{sec:pronoun_coding}
      Coding tokens of subject pronouns is essentially about deciding how and what to count in the data.
      Some of those decisions are relatively trivial.
      For instance, when speakers hesitated or restarted the same clause, rather than counting each utterance of a subject pronoun throughout those restarts, only the final subject pronoun uttered was counted.
      More complicated is determining how to manage pronouns that may or may not be phonetic variants of a single target pronoun and determining which referent a given pronoun token is targetting.

      \subsubsection{Phonetic variants}
        \label{sec:phonetic_variants}
        The analyses carried out here are lexical rather than phonetic, but ambiguities easily arise in which two distinct pronouns can have identical phonetic realizations or in which several phonetic forms may all be realizations of a single target pronoun.
        Disentangling these ambiguities is essential for accurately counting pronoun tokens.
        One such example, that of [mo], [mɔ̃], [mwa], and [mwɛ̃], was discussed in section \ref{sec:pronoun_structure}, but others exist, as well.
        The pronouns under which these phonetic forms were grouped in the analysis are summarized in Table \ref{tab:phonetic_variants} where only those phonetic realizations that actually occurred in the data are provided, hence \lexi{mo} was coded as such due to only [mo] and [m] occurring.
        Others will be discussed below.

        \end{table}

        A number of cases can easily be accounted for as they represent well-known liaisons in which a latent final consonant is produced only when the following word begins with a vowel.
        One of these is the [n] at the end of \lexi{on} (\citeauthor{oukada_louisiana_1977}, \citeyear[p.~192]{oukada_louisiana_1977}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~53]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        Likewise, an [l] liaison often occurs at the end of \lexi{il} as well as \lexi{elle} (\citeauthor{chaudoir_study_1938}, \citeyear[p.~33]{chaudoir_study_1938}; \citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~144]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~42-43]{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~218-219]{phillips_spoken_1939}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~47]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        The latter additionally can be realized with the vowel [ɛ] or [a] (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~144]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~83]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~47]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        Studies that attest to both forms consider them to be variants of the same pronoun, thus they were treated as such here.
        The pronouns \lexi{nous} and \lexi{vous} have been widely attested throughout the francophone world as producing [z] liaisons, but there was an additional ambiguity created by their non-liaison forms, [nu] and [vu], that will be discussed later in this section.
        Similarly well attested through the world is a [z] liaison for \lexi{elles}.
        This pronoun is very rare in Louisiana and only appeared in liaison contexts in my data, making it unambiguous.
        Finally, \lexi{ils} is also widely known to generate a [z] liaison, but in Louisiana, it can also be realized with an [l] liaison (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~145]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~84]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~58]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        This case presents significant ambiguities with \lexi{il} and even \lexi{li} which will be discussed further down.
        Documented liaisons therefore helped categorize a number of phonetic realizations with their appropriate pronoun morphemes.
        % on
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, however, there's an example of "on" without a liaison: on ôte as [ɔ̃ ot] (Guilbeau 1950, as cited in Papen & Rottet 1997:78)
        % elle
          % Collapsed these: [ɛl] [ɛ] [al] [a]
            % Considered different realizations of the same morpheme in the literature (Papen & Rottet 1997:83)
          % In Lafayette, Conwell & Juilland (1963) reported that [al] was rare, [ɛ(l)] being preferred (Conwell & Juilland 1963:144)
            % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Parr (1940) reported [al] as the norm and [ɛ] only even being possible before consonants (xi)
              % Similarly, in Lafayette, [ɛ(l)] was rare enough that J. S. Smith (1994) mused that this might have simply been a disjunctive pronoun being produced without the resumptive clitic pronoun (47) as the disjunctive has only been reported as [ɛl]
              % Some have only attested [ɛl] as a disjunctive (Chaudoir 1938:33; Phillips 1936:43)
              % Girard Lomheim (2019) did no more than provide a table of the subject pronoun morphemes, but listed "alle" and not "elle" (5), suggesting the same lack of [ɛl] in Vermilion and St Landry

        Some well-known vowel elisions in the same linguistic context (\foreign{i.e.}, before a word-initial vowel in the next word) also account for a number of phonetic forms attested in the present data.
        A particularly straightforward case is that of \lexi{yé} (\citeauthor{broussard_louisiana_1972}, \citeyear[p.~8]{broussard_louisiana_1972}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~209-210]{klingler_if_2003}) as neither its full nor reduced forms can be confused with any other pronoun.
        This is not true of \lexi{tu} and \lexi{to} which have both been found to reduce to [t], which will be discussed in more detail later.
        The vowel of \lexi{je} is standardly elided in French varieties around the world, whereas in the Louisiana the vowel and consonant are typically metathesized (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~141]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{chaudoir_study_1938}, \citeyear[pp.~31-32]{chaudoir_study_1938}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}).
        Distinguishing between metathesized and elided realizations in casual speech can be quite difficult, but the effect is essentially the same in that the consonant is what stands out.
        The range of possible consonants is significant and will thus be discussed more later in this section as will the homophony of some of these with the elided versions of \lexi{ça}/\lexi{ce}.
        For most elisions, their widespread treatments in the literature made it trivial to decide whether they were realizations of distinct pronouns or not just as with liaisons.
        % yé
          % Can reduce to [j] even before consonants as long as not preceded by another consonant (Klingler 2003 "Turn":210)
        
        % nous and vous phonologically distinct behavior from nou and vou
        The phonetic forms [nuz], [nu], and [no] presented significant questions about whether speakers and listeners interpret these as one, two, or three distinct pronouns.
        The form [nu] has been found in both French-oriented and Creole-oriented speech in Louisiana but with different behaviors.
        In Terrebonne-Lafourche, where Creole is not present, [nu] generates a [z] liaison when followed by a vowel \parencite[pp.~190-191]{oukada_louisiana_1977}, just as one finds in Hexagonal French.
        The same was found in Lafayette \parencite[pp.~142-143]{conwell_louisiana_1963}, which contrasts with Terrebonne-Lafourche in being a region where creolophones are found.
        In Creole-oriented speech, on the other hand, such a linguistic environment (\foreign{i.e.}, before a vowel) leads to a reduction of [nu] to [n] \parencite[p.~8]{broussard_louisiana_1972}, something which is even possible before consonants for some speakers \parencite[pp.~209-210]{klingler_if_2003}.
        This difference in behavior might suggest that speakers have different morpheme targets in their mental grammars, perhaps \lexi{nous} versus \lexi{nou}, or at least different morphophonemic rules.
        What is more important here, though, is whether speakers treat these as distinct pronouns as that would allow them to be socially interpreted differently in the sense of functioning as markers of Creole or Cajun identity\footnote{
          Of course, even if interpreted as a single pronoun with several phonetic variants, those phonetic variants can be socially interpreted differently, as well.
          However, the goal of the present study was not to conduct a sociophonetic analysis.
        }.
        
        
        Two factors support the idea that they are treated as distinct.
        The first is that Creole-oriented speakers may alternate between [nu] and [no] (\citeauthor{morgan_structural_1959}, \citeyear[p.~24c]{morgan_structural_1959}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~166]{neumann_creole_1985}), whereas French-oriented speakers do not, which thus phonetically distinguishes \lexi{nous} - \lexi{nou} to a greater degree.
        This was in fact the case for one speaker in my own corpus, Tracy Roth, who produced both [nu] and [no] before consonants and vowels, as in sentences \ref{sent:nu_tracy} and \ref{sent:no_tracy}, but never with a [z] liaison, suggesting that there is a morpheme \lexi{nou} that varies in vowel quality that is distinct from another morpheme \lexi{nous} that forms liaisons.
        This is admittedly a weak argument for treating these as different pronouns, however.
        The factor that provides a stronger argument for a distinction is the inflectional morphology used for verbs.
        For instance, while Owen Webre produced many tokens of [no], the few tokens of [nu] that he produced were followed by Standard French verbal inflections as in sentences \ref{sent:nu1_owen} and \ref{sent:nu2_owen}.
        These verbal inflections are rare enough in Louisiana that they are sometimes described as not existing \parencite[p.~96]{papen_structural_1997}, and Owen in fact did not use such inflections when producing [no], suggesting that two separate lexical items exist in his mental grammar: \lexi{no}/\lexi{nou} and \lexi{nous}.
        With these factors in mind, [nu] was grouped with [no] when there were no inflectional nor phonological factors indicating that the target was \lexi{nous}, and as the [no] phonetic form was far more frequent than the [nu] form with which it was aggregated, the alternative pronoun will henceforth be denoted as \lexi{no}.
        % Other non-liaison examples: Rachel Chenevert produces only [no], never with [z] even before vowels (e.g., no apprenne 6:33 and 7:00)

        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item {}[nu] apprend un tas. \label{sent:nu_tracy} (Tracy Roth, 17:33)
          \item[] \gloss{We learn a lot.}
          \item {}[no] apprenne comment pour laver. \label{sent:no_tracy} (Tracy Roth, 31:20)
          \item[] \gloss{We learned how to wash.}
          \item {}[nu] disons quelqu'un qui'tait gain des animaux ou bien des bêtes comme ça. \label{sent:nu1_owen} (Owen Webre, 3:32)
          \item[] \gloss{We say someone that had some animals or rather some livestock like that.}
          \item {}[nu] sommes les mondes qui devraient être d'un certain niveau, quelque chose comme cela. \label{sent:nu2_owen} (Owen Webre, 14:47)
          \item[] \gloss{We're the people who should be of a certain level, something like that.}
        \end{enumerate}

        The phonetic forms [vu] and [vuz]\footnote{
          Although [vo] is also attested in the literature as alternating with [vu] in Creole-oriented speech (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~206/213]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{morgan_structural_1959}, \citeyear[p.~24c]{morgan_structural_1959}), [vo] did not appear in my data.
        } received much the same treatment as the above.
        Once again, in French-oriented speech, [vu] takes a [z] liaison, yielding [vuz], whereas in Creole-oriented speech, there is instead a reduction to simply [v] (\citeauthor{broussard_louisiana_1972}, \citeyear[p.~8]{broussard_louisiana_1972}; \citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[pp.~142-143]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[p.~209]{klingler_if_2003}).
        One difference, however, is that verbal inflections are not paritcularly helpful for disambiguating tokens of [vu] when not followed by a vowel.
        The Standard French inflectional pattern results in an /e/ at the end of a verb when the subject pronoun is \lexi{vous}.
        For French-oriented speakers in Louisiana, this is true for some but not for others, the latter simply using the same bare verb for all inflections \parencite[p.~52]{byers_defining_1988}.\footnote{
          \citeauthor{byers_defining_1988}'s (\citeyear{byers_defining_1988}) results suggest that this was a change in progress as those over 45 were more likely to produce a verb final /e/ with \lexi{vous} (pp.~71-74).
        }
        The resulting phonetic forms are identical to what have been called short and long forms of verbs in studies of Creole in Louisiana which for most verbs means without a final /e/ versus with a final /e/, respectively.\footnote{
          While Creole as spoken in Pointe Coupee has been noted for sometimes using long verb forms for the present habitual \parencite[p.~237]{klingler_if_2003}, this was only expressed with short verb forms in my data.
        }
        These patterns are summarized in Tables \ref{tab:inflect_manger_sf} through \ref{tab:inflect_manger_lc}.
        As a result, only irregularly inflected verbs could serve as diagnostics for the pronoun, such as in sentence \ref{sent:vu_deborah} which was coded as \lexi{vous} given its correspondance with the Standard French irregular inflection of \lexi{savoir} as \lexi{savez}.
        Fortunately, with the relatively low count of [vu], almost all tokens could still be classified as \lexi{vou} or \lexi{vous} based on the presence or absence of a liaison and verbal morphology.
        The few remaining tokens were produced by speakers who otherwise categorically used \lexi{vou} or \lexi{vous} in more transparent linguistic contexts and so were classified as being the same.
        Unfortunately, the low count also meant that no participant used both \lexi{vou} and \lexi{vous} so their status as distinct pronouns for F\&C speakers can only be assumed.
        % vou (mostly), vo, and ou in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":206/213), but I suspect ou is simply lenition of [v] in vou

        % Lots of possible confusion with [i] and [il] being non-liaison versions of singular or plural or even /li/
        The much more frequent phonetic form [i] was the most complicated phonetic realization of a subject pronoun to disentangle as it can represent an underlying \lexi{il}, \lexi{ils}, or \lexi{li} (\citeauthor{chaudoir_study_1938}, \citeyear[p.~33]{chaudoir_study_1938}; \citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~144]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~210-211]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~170]{neumann_creole_1985}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~84]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~42-43]{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[pp.~218-219]{phillips_spoken_1939}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[pp.~47/58]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        The form [i] itself was excluded as a possible underlying form as only two speakers produced [i] but never [il] nor [iz] nor [ilz] for third person plural referents: Austin Roy and Floyd Kerry.
        Their tokens of [i] were furthermore all accompanied by irregular verbs inflected as they would be in Standard French as in sentences \ref{sent:i_plural_austin1} and \ref{sent:i_plural_floyd}, suggesting that they could be treated as tokens of \lexi{ils}, or otherwise regular verbs that do not contradict such a treatment as in sentence \ref{sent:i_plural_austin2}.
        For all other cases, the general process of coding tokens as \lexi{il}, \lexi{ils}, or \lexi{li} followed three steps: 1) determine if the referent is third person plural or not through either verbal morphology or co-referring expressions, treating third person plural and non-third person plural as two separate categories, 2) find the most complete phonetic realization of the pronoun and assume that all others are abbreviated versions of that token, and finally 3) verify that there are no other complete phonetic realizations that represent an alternative, contradicting pronoun.
        
        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item Mes grands-parents à moi, [i] sont beaucoup plus vieux que l'autre monde de mon âge. (Austin Roy, 15:01) \label{sent:i_plural_austin1}
          \item[] \gloss{My grandparents, they're a lot older than other people my age.}
          \item Les vieilles mondes, [i] sont partis, to connais? (Floyd Kerry, 13:10) \label{sent:i_plural_floyd}
          \item[] \gloss{The old people, they're gone, you know?}
          \item Mes grands-parents, [i] parliont tout le français. (Austin Roy, 14:52) \label{sent:i_plural_austin2}
          \item[] \gloss{My grandparents, they all spoke French.}
        \end{enumerate}

        In general, applying these steps was a straightforward process.
        For tokens with third person plural referents, speakers with tokens of [i] or [il] before consonants typically had tokens that also came before vowels where a [z] liaison was present without having any contradictory tokens before vowels, allowing all tokens to be coded as \lexi{ils}.
        Likewise, for non-third person plural referents, speakers who produced [i] before consonants otherwise had either only tokens of [il] or only tokens of [li], allowing the [i] tokens to be coded as \lexi{il} or \lexi{li}, respectively.
        This case was, however, complicated for speakers who produced both [il] and [li] as this made it impossible to determine the underlying target for tokens of non-third person plural [i].
        Only two speakers presented this scenario: Oliver Lesage and Owen Webre.
        While their tokens of non-third person plural [i] had to be excluded as a result, they also provided solid evidence that F\&C speakers interpret [il] and [li] as distinct pronouns through the fact that they produced both, making them available to be socially meaningful.
        In Oliver's case, his use of [li] was accompanied by meta-linguistic commentary that made it clear that he was displaying his ability to speak what he called \foreign{couru vini}.

        A final complication for \lexi{il}, \lexi{ils}, and \lexi{li} came from what has been interpreted in the literature as variability in the liaisons produced for \lexi{ils} in that the liaison can be the typical [z] found in French varieties around the world or an atypical [l] that is common in Louisiana (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[p.~145]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~84]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~58]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        Among the current participants, Alice Lemaire, Lillian Himel, and Terry Guillot produced only [l] liaisons, although only Terry produced a significant number of tokens out of these three.
        While this might suggest that a speaker such as Terry has one pronoun, \lexi{il}, that is used for both third person plural referents as well as various singular referents, evidence from other speakers supports interpreting all third person plural tokens with an [l] liaison as targeting \lexi{ils} in that others produced both [l] and [z] liaisons.
        Bruce Wiltz and Jack Munson, for instance, primarily used an [l] liaison, but each also produced one token of [ilz] before a vowel.
        On the other hand, Dennis Oubre and Lucille Royer produced mostly [z] liaisons before vowels but Dennis also had two tokens of [il] and Lucille one token.
        These speakers' linguistic behaviors point to the idea that there is some phonetic variation in the liaison of a single underlying pronoun, \lexi{ils}, thus those speakers who only produced [l] liaisons had their tokens coded as \lexi{ils}.
  
        Another phonetically complicated pronoun in Louisiana is \lexi{je} in that the consonant can be realized in many different ways, all of those that have been attested in the literature also showing up in the data here.
        As already mentioned, the vowel [ə] in \lexi{je} has been found to elide not only before vowels \parencite[p.~193]{oukada_louisiana_1977} but also before consonants (\citeauthor{phillips_spoken_1939}, \citeyear[pp.~218-219]{phillips_spoken_1939}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~43]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        The appearance of the vowel has even been argued to be only produced for ``clarity or emphasis'' \parencite[p.~141]{conwell_louisiana_1963}.
        Also, as with other short function words, metathesis is typical (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~141]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{chaudoir_study_1938}, \citeyear[pp.~31-32]{chaudoir_study_1938}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}).
        The vowel thus appears to be the least significant part of the morpheme, leaving variations in the consonants [ʒ], [ʃ], [z], [s], and [h] left to be explained.
        % This results in the consonant, which can be realized as  \parencite[p.~72]{carmichael_language_2019}, being adjacent to the initial segment of the following word.
        A devoicing phonological rule that applies to this particular morpheme where [ʒ] and [z] are devoiced before voiceless segments, as in Rule \ref{rule:pro_devoicing}, has been proposed a number of times (\citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~82]{papen_structural_1997}; \citeauthor{phillips_etude_1936}, \citeyear[p.~42]{phillips_etude_1936}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[pp.~127/176]{rottet_language_1995}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~43]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        When this devoicing results in [ʃ] or [s], the pronoun \lexi{je} suddenly becomes homophonous with realizations of \lexi{ça}, as well.
        These were disambiguated according to function in that only those with a first person plural reference were considered tokens of \lexi{je}.
        % C' treated as underlying ça
          % While you could perhaps argue that this should be underlying ce, none of my speakers produced a surface ce form (e.g., no ce sont nor ce n'est pas)
            % There are also cases like Florence Gaspard saying un petit brin l'argent c'était couru loin (38:13), whereas a more French oriented speaker would likely say un petit brin d'argent ça courait loin
              % And to be even clearer, my Creole oriented speakers did indeed by and large use ça for this/that just as the French oriented speakers did, so while one could say that an utterance from one speaker cannot be used as foolproof evidence of an underlying form for another speaker, there are multiple reasons to believe that these forms would be linked
          % Ça with fait is coded as expletive both when meaning "it's been" or as the conjunction and discourse marker meaning "so"

        \begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*., ref=\Roman*, series=rules]
          \item \phonr{\phonfeat{+pronoun \\ +1sg \\ +apical \\ +voiced}}{\phonfeat{-voiced}}{\phonfeat{-voiced}} \label{rule:pro_devoicing}
        \end{enumerate}

        Of the remaining forms, there is a more general variation between [ʒ] and [h] where either can variably appear in the same position in any morpheme, allowing for the conclusion that [h] is a variant form of \lexi{je}.
        This wide distribution is not present, however, for [z], which is only in variation with [ʒ] in the pronoun \lexi{je} \parencite[p.~121]{dajko_ethnic_2009}.
        While one could possibly argue that [z] and [ʒ] represent two distinct morphemes based on this, \citeauthor{dajko_ethnic_2009}'s (\citeyear{dajko_ethnic_2009}) data shows [z] in stylistic variation with [ʒ], suggesting individual speakers use both variants.
        Likewise, the one participant in my data who used [z], Arthur Rousseau, primarily produced [ʒ] and [ʃ].
        It is certainly not out of the question that such an individual could have two different subject pronouns in their mental grammar for the same referent, but this seems less likely when the sole difference is a slight change in place of articulation.
        The evidence suggests then that all of these realizations are variants of one subject pronoun: \lexi{je}.

        % Similar to [i] ambiguity, [t] ambiguity for [ty] or [to]
        Ambiguity is also caused by the frequent vowel elisions of \lexi{to} and \lexi {tu} as both can be realized as [t].
        Unlike the identical surface forms for \lexi{je} and \lexi{ça}, disentangling whether speakers are targeting \lexi{tu} or \lexi{to} cannot be done using linguistic context as both take up the same linguistic functions, those being second person and impersonal.
        What does help, however, is that [t] without a vowel has not been noted to occur before a consonant in the literature.
        As a result, there were always fully pronounced tokens of \lexi{tu} or \lexi{to} in the speech of my participants.
        Thus, those who categorically produced \lexi{tu} and [t] had the latter coded as \lexi{tu}, whereas those who categorically produced [to] and [t] had the latter coded as \lexi{to}.
        For speakers who produced all three surface forms, their tokens of [t] were excluded from the data.
        % Oukada (1977) reported the generalized loss of a pronoun's vowel before verbs that begin with vowels based on the occurrence of t'es (193)
        % "to" can be reduced to [t] (Broussard 1972:8; Klingler 2003 "Turn":209-210; Phillips 1936:43)

        Written above is \lexi{tu} rather than [ty] because yet another phonetic form, [ti], again raises questions about underlying forms.
        In the first place, speaker production and metalinguistic commentary suggest that speakers interpret [ty] and [to] as different pronouns.
        Oliver Lesage, for instance, produced [to] and [ty] but the former only when he brought up that he could also speak Creole and gave me an example.
        For other speakers who produced both forms, other linguistic structures also shifted along with them.
        Both Owen Webre and Tracy Roth produced both [to] and [ty], but his verbal inflections became more Creole-like or more French-like depending on which one was used, and their syntax relative to object pronouns did likewise.
        Sentence \ref{sent:tu_owen}, then, inflects the modal auxiliary verb \lexi{devoir} \gloss{to must} to express a suggestion, but sentence \ref{sent:to_owen} uses the Creole-marked structure \lexi{gain pour} to express obligation.
        Likewise, sentence \ref{sent:tu_tracy} uses the preverbal object pronoun \lexi{me} rather than a postverbal object pronoun as in sentence \ref{sent:to_tracy}.
        It should be noted that there are exceptions to this patterning, such as sentence \ref{sent:to_tracy_exception} where imperfective past is expressed with an inflected form of \lexi{pouvoir} \lexi{to be able to}, but these truly are exceptions in that, in this case, Tracy almost always relied on auxiliary verbs to express imperfective past as in sentence \ref{sent:to_tracy_past}.
        Only one speaker who produced both [ty] and [to], Errol Stoufle, did not adjust the surrounding linguistic structures along with the pronoun.
        For Errol, however, every token of [ty] was the tag question \lexi{tu connais} \gloss{you know}, which he produced frequently.

        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item Tu devrais avoir une autre langue. (Owen Webre, 25:26) \label{sent:tu_owen}
          \item[] \gloss{You should have another language.}
          \item To gain pour guetter les Américains. (Owen Webre, 17:44) \label{sent:to_owen}
          \item[] \gloss{You have to watch Americans.}
          \item Tu me peux fais ça. (Tracy Roth, 17:40) \label{sent:tu_tracy}
          \item[] \gloss{You can do that for me.}
          \item To trappé li encore. (Tracy Roth, 15:24) \label{sent:to_tracy}
          \item[] \gloss{You caught him again.}
          \item To pouvais fais du sucre. (Tracy Roth, 8:40) \label{sent:to_tracy_exception}
          \item[] \gloss{You could make some sugar.}
          \item To'tais peux couru là. (Tracy Roth, 4:44) \label{sent:to_tracy_past}
          \item[] \gloss{You could go there.}
        \end{enumerate}

        It is not difficult to conclude that [ty] and [to] are distinct for speakers, then, but [ty] and [ti] present a different scenario in that they appear in identical linguistic contexts for those speakers who produce both.
        Gene Delcambre's speech exemplifies this in sentences such as \ref{sent:ti_gene} and \ref{sent:tu_gene} below.
        This is in fact one of several arguments for treating [ty] and [ti] as the same target pronoun for speakers.
        The literature on French in Louisiana (but not Creole) has also consistently presented these as variants of \lexi{tu} (\citeauthor{conwell_louisiana_1963}, \citeyear[pp.~142-143]{conwell_louisiana_1963}; \citeauthor{parr_glossary_1940}, \citeyear[p.~xi]{parr_glossary_1940}; \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}, \citeyear[p.~45]{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}).
        Part of this interpretation is likely due to their distributions being the same but it is also notable that the vowels are very close, only differing in lip-rounding.
        Among my own participants, those who produced [ti] appeared more so to have partially weakened lip-rounding rather than a clear [i] save for one participant, Austin Roy, who is a late learner of F\&C and who categorically pruduced a very clear and distinct [i] in every token.
        These factors therefore suggest that two target pronouns are at play in this case: \lexi{tu} and \lexi{to}.
        
        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item {}[ti] vas venir jouer pour moi à ce soir. (Gene Delcambre, 33:01) \label{sent:ti_gene}
          \item[] \gloss{You're going to come play for me tonight.}
          \item {}[ty] vas aller à la grocerie. (Gene Delcambre, 19:13) \label{sent:tu_gene}
          \item[] \gloss{You're going to go to the grocery store.}
        \end{enumerate}

        Finally, there are three other pronouns that have been described in the literature as having various phonetic realizations but all were realized with only one phonetic form in my data.
        Those include \lexi{vous-autres} as [vuzɔt], \lexi{eux} as [ø], and \lexi{eux-autres} as [øzɔt].
        Their counts were also extremely low.
        While the goal of this section was to clarify how phonetic variants were aggregated for the sake of accurate counting of tokens, the issue of low count variants will be taken up in section \ref{sec:analysis_methods}.

        % vous-autres
          % Generally written with <-res>, probably due to its disjunctive use in SF, but no final consonants are attested in Louisiana even in liaison positions (i.e., no [r_V] nor [z_V])
          % zòt, zo, and ouzò(t) are attested in Pointe coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":206/213) as well as zot, zo, and uzot in Breaux Bridge (Neumann 1985:166), but I suspect these are various lenitions of /v/ and /t/
            % Neumann (1985) remarked surprise that zot had not been attested by the time of her study despite it being used in Saint-Ybars (Mercier 1881) (169), perhaps because it was registered as a form of vous-autres
          % [wɔt] is attested for vous-autres in rapid speech in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Rottet 1995:185-186)
  
        % eux
          % More often written as <eusse>, but <eux> is used here simply to highlight its origin and because this is a somewhat regularized process (e.g., ceux can be pronounced with a final [s])
          % eux has several phonetic variants attested: [ø], [øs], [øz], and [zø] in Lafourche (Rottet 1995:201) as well as generally throughout South Louisiana (Byers 1988:88-92)
            % Oukada (1977) reported the same except for no [zø] (192)
  
        % eux-autres
          % Same as with vous-autres, the general orthographic representation includes the <-res> despite it not being pronounced
          % eux-autres has several variants attested: [øzot], [zøt], [zot], and [hɔt] (Rottet 1995:201)

        % B. Brown (1988) interpreted c'est as an impersonal expression, and by extension ça, and that the c'est is "lexicalized" rather than the combination of c' and est (130-131)
          % B. Brown (1988) discussed the c' in "c'est" as a variant of ça (130/138-143)
            % She follows Thibault (1986) in this interpretation for French in Montreal (141-142)
          % I agree that it can be impersonal, but in the vast majority of cases, it is difficult to rule out either a demonstrative interpretation or a presentative use (which is somewhat demonstrative, as well)
          % For lexicalization, her evidence is that ça sont doesn't occur nor ça n'est pas, and while I can't rule out the possibility that it's lexicalized, this evidence feels weak to me
        % Klingler (2003 "Turn") gives examples of c'est as impersonal, equivalent to "it" (he seems to have meant expletive), but they could all be interpreted as "that" also (309-310)

      \subsubsection{Pronoun types}
        \label{sec:pronoun_types}
        Having dealt with the phonetic forms that pronouns can take, there is still the issue of coding each token for its pronoun type.
        The possible pronoun types in the current data are summarized in Table \ref{tab:pronouns_attested} along with the variants that occurred for each.
        The categories cover all possible person and number combinations, a T-V distinction for second person singular, and a gender distinction for third person singular.
        Demonstrative, expletive, and impersonal pronoun types were also present in the data and so considered for analysis, although demonstratives were effectively categorical as only \Sexpr{tablesProTypeAll$demonstrative["ø"]} null token was found whereas all others were \lexi{ça}.
        These latter three pronoun types were defined, respectively, as pronouns that are primarily deictic in nature, pronouns that make no reference and do not contribute to the meaning of the proposition, and pronouns that have a generic reference.
        While classifying most pronoun tokens was relatively straightforward, there were some more complicated cases which will be discussed in this section.

        \end{table}
        % Some 3sg neuter pronouns were produced (e.g., Austin using ça in the same way as English singular they) but are left out because they aren't being analyzed

        In determining the possible pronoun types, an agnostic approach was taken for gender and animacy.
        In other words, while evidence from the literature discussed in section \ref{sec:pronoun_structure} provided guidelines for what to expect, all possible person and number combinations were initially coded for all possible gender combinations (\foreign{i.e.}, masculine, feminine, mixed), and singular and plural third person tokens were all initially coded for animacy\footnote{
          Animacy is not relevant to first and second person pronouns unless one assumes that inanimate objects can speak or listen.
        }.
        In doing so, some distinctions for gender and animacy were able to be ruled out.
        For instance, Figure \ref{fig:1pl_gender} shows that all 1pl pronoun forms can refer to all gender combinations with the exception of \lexi{ça} with only \Sexpr{nrow(subsetsGender$firstPl[subsetsGender$firstPl$ProUnder == "ça",])} token and \lexi{vous-autres} also with only \Sexpr{nrow(subsetsGender$firstPl[subsetsGender$firstPl$ProUnder == "vous-autres",])} token.
        Likewise, Figure \ref{fig:3sg_gender_animcy} makes it plainly evident that 3sg animacy is not expressed through pronoun choice as the distributions of 3sg.AF and 3sg.AM are essentially identical as are the distributions of 3sg.IF and 3sg.IM, despite the overall counts of inanimate pronouns being much smaller.
        Gender, on the other hand, can be expressed in that \lexi{elle} is relegated to feminine referents only and \lexi{il} almost entirely to masculine referents.
        For 3pl pronouns, the gender reference was very often ambiguous, but among those that did make clear references for gender and animacy, Figure \ref{fig:3pl_gender_animcy} suggest that 3pl pronouns are neutral for both grammatical features.
        Only \lexi{elles} was exclusive to feminine referents but was very infrequent whereas all other pronouns regularly referred to feminine, masculine, and feminine-masculine groups.
        Again, the much smaller count for inanimate tokens makes it more difficult to draw conclusions, but from what is available, all 3pl pronouns can be used for both animate and inanimate reference save for the very rare \lexi{elles} not appearing for inanimate referents and \lexi{yé} being absent for 3pl inanimate feminine referents.
        The latter's presence for all other categories suggests that this was coincidental rather than impossible, however.
        Finally, gender for 2pl was also found to be an unimportant distinction as \lexi{vous-autres} was used for all possible genders with only \Sexpr{nrow(subsetsGender$secondPl[subsetsGender$secondPl$ProUnder == "vous",])} tokens of \lexi{vous} whose gender reference could be conclusively identified was produced.

        A grammatical feature that was significantly more difficult to accurately interpret for coding was the T-V distinction for 2sg pronouns to the extent that any conclusions drawn about these pronouns from the current data must be considered very tentative.
        The coding decision itself consisted of determining whether tokens of primarily \lexi{tu}, \lexi{to}, \lexi{vous}, and \lexi{vou} were meant to be understand as T (informal) or V (formal) forms of 2sg.
        As discussed in section \ref{sec:pronoun_social}, surface forms such as \lexi{tu} have been found in the literature to be used at times for V addressees, so while the question might appear to be answered by simply assuming that \lexi{tu} and \lexi{to} are always T forms and \lexi{vous} and \lexi{vou} are always V forms, that is not necessarily the case.
        Contextually, the primary clue for whether T of V was intended was the age of the interlocutor, myself in most cases, in that the literature has consistently found that older interlocutors received V forms and younger T forms.
        This generally coincided with my own participants' linguistic behavior when they explicitly commented on the T-V distinction.
        One participants in her 60s appeared to be offended at one point because I was using \lexi{vous} with her which she explained was for people older than her.
        However, another participant in her 70s who I addressed with \lexi{vous} quickly asked me to switch to \lexi{tu}, joking that we had known each other for several minutes and that was long enough that we could drop the formality.
        Age was thus an indication of intention but not completely sufficient.
        
        Another strategy was to use to rely on deviations from a participant's speech patterns.
        For instance, if a participant consistently referred to me using \lexi{tu} or \lexi{to} and then suddenly referred to me using \lexi{vous} or \lexi{vou}, this might be an indication that the latter were meant to be understood as T forms despite their surface structure.
        However, this was also not fully sufficient because it could have also meant that the former were meant to be understood as V forms instead.
        Casting even more doubt on this strategy was the fact that some participants appeared to have more eratic patterns.
        One such case was Rose Louvière who would address me using \lexi{tu} for subject pronouns but \lexi{vous} for disjunctive pronouns as in sentences \ref{sent:rose_TV1} and \ref{sent:rose_TV2}.
        Again, while such patterns were instructive, they were not completely sufficient.

        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item Ça peut tour asteur, tu vois? (Rose Louvière, 22:54) \label{sent:rose_TV1}
          \item[] \gloss{They can tour now, you see?}
          \item Il est plus gros que vous (Rose Louvière, 22:32) \label{sent:rose_TV2}
          \item[] \gloss{He is bigger than you.}
        \end{enumerate}

        A final aid for determining T-V intentions for 2sg pronouns was the translation task that some participants completed.
        Indeed, this was the principal method of data collection in past studies that looked as subject pronouns in that contexts could be created that would more conclusively elicit either T forms or V forms, something that is not very possible using the sociolinguistic interviews on which the present study primarily relied.
        The translation task involved speakers of all ages and relationships addressing each other, such as a child addressing their grandfather.
        While quite helpful, there remains a question of whether participants who completed the task were truly placing themselves in all the various roles when choosing which pronouns to use.

        Relatedly, whereas 2sg pronouns were difficult to conclusively code as T or V forms, the task was impossible for 2pl as only \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "2pl",])} tokens were produced.
        Likewise, the relevance of gender for 2pl pronouns was also not able to be determined.
        All tokens were instead simply aggregated into one category.
        % vous (sg.+formal) vs vous (pl.)
          % Use context to distinguish between thhem
            % e.g., If I've only been tutoyer'd by the participant and then a relation of mine is mentioned and then there's suddenly a vous, it's likely plural

        The construction \lexi{c'est} presented a different sort of complication for coding.
        As \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} did (pp.~173-174), tokens of \lexi{c'} were coded as \lexi{ça} for this study, but they were not interpreted in the same way.
        While \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} described \lexi{c'est} as an impersonal expression (pp.~130-131) -- by which she likely meant expletive -- this was only one of the possible uses acknowledged here, the other being demonstrative or the closely related presentative function.
        It is also tempting to consider \lexi{c'est} as being third person and definite, especially in translating into English where \lexi{it} would often be used rather than the demonstrative \lexi{this/that}, but it seems more likely that the functional range of \lexi{it}-\lexi{this/that} is not the same as \lexi{il/elle/li}-\lexi{c'/ça}.
        Even in Hexagonal French, this proves to be the case as can be seen in the acceptability of sentences \ref{sent:it_vs_that_unaccept} and \ref{sent:it_vs_that_accept}, where direct translations to English, as provided here, would lead to the opposite result for acceptability judgements.
        This is even more evidentally the case in Louisiana where \lexi{il/elle/li est} for inanimate referents or expletive functions is essentially completely absent as \lexi{c'est} is used in these cases.
        As a result, almost all tokens of \lexi{c'est} were coded as demonstrative/presentative including in interrogatives, such as in sentence \ref{sent:interrogative_cest}, as those are perhaps best interpreted as presentatives.
        Otherwiuse, tokens that were clearly expletive such as sentence \ref{sent:judy_cest} were coded as such and \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$SubjPred == "c'est" & tokens$ProType == "3pl",])} tokens that strongly suggested 3pl reference were also coded as such.

        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item *Le livre, il est un roman intéressant. \label{sent:it_vs_that_unaccept}
          \item[] \gloss{The book, it's an interesting novel.}
          \item Le livre, c'est un roman intéressant. \label{sent:it_vs_that_accept}
          \item[] \gloss{*The book, that's an interesting novel.}
          \item Quoi c'est l'expression, love conquers all? (Brian Roger, 5:28) \label{sent:interrogative_cest}
          \item[] \gloss{What's the expression, love conquers all?}
          \item C'est trop chaud. (Judy Soileau Courtade, 9:15) \label{sent:judy_cest}
          \item[] \gloss{It's too hot. (the weather)}
        \end{enumerate}
        
        A pronoun that can take up truly impersonal functions is \lexi{on}.
        In this case, there is the complication of deciding whether tokens of \lexi{on} are impersonal or are making first person plural reference \parencite{laberge_anything_1980} as either interpretation often works without creating confusion.
        Indeed, somewhat analogously, the English pronoun \lexi{we} can be impersonal or 1pl \parencite{kitagawa_impersonal_1990}, suggesting that this dual function is not terribly unusual, and one might guess that is because of the shared aspects of the semantics of both uses.
        Even in contexts where a fairly impersonal meaning is being expressed, as in sentence \ref{sent:ambiguous_on}, it is not entirely clear that the intended meaning is not \gloss{we} in the sense of \gloss{we, the people of Louisiana}.
        The coding strategy for ambiguous tokens of \lexi{on} was therefore based on what would least skew the distributions for impersonal pronouns and 1pl pronouns.
        As it was expected and in fact came to be, clearly impersonal \lexi{on} would be rare (\Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "imp" & tokens$ProUnder == "on",])} tokens) whereas clearly 1pl \lexi{on} would be very frequent (\Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "1pl" & tokens$ProUnder == "on",])} tokens), coding ambiguous tokens as 1pl would be the more conservative choice and thus what was done here.

        \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          \item Si c'est on est après parler avec quelqu'un, on dit charrer. (Jerry Pierre Quintero, 0:32) \label{sent:ambiguous_on}
          \item[] \gloss{If it's that \emph{one is/we are} speaking with someone, \emph{one/we} say charrer.}
        \end{enumerate}

        % Lagniappe -----------------------------------------
        % ça, eux, eux-autres, and yé when referring to 3pl
          % Code these as masculine when any one of the referents is masculine
            % These are likely gender-less
              % Papen & Rottet (1997:84) claimed as much for the first 3
              % Neumann (1985:166) and Klingler (2003 "Turn":209) claimed as much for yé
            % This groups them with ils, which Papen & Rottet (1997) also claim in genderless in LA (84), and ils in SF is nearly genderless
          % Code these as feminine if they ever end up being clearly used for a group of exclusively female referents

        % Sometimes a 3pl pronoun can be making a generic reference (e.g., ça connaît pas s'il a venu where 'they' have not been specified at all in the context)
          % In these cases, these will be annotated as 3pl (masculine) rather than imp (impersonal)
            % Masculine because the referent is likely something like "people" or "such and such group of people" and that group is unlikely to be exclusively female.
          % Impersonal you for instance is clearly not the person being spoken to, but generic they could involve an actual imagined referent

        % Subordinate clause stuff
          % Finally, a small remark must be made on subordinate clauses.
          % Given that object relative pronouns in both French and Creole in Louisiana are frequently null (\citeauthor{brown_pronominal_1988}, \citeyear[p.~125]{brown_pronominal_1988}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[p.~225]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}, \citeyear[p.~223]{rottet_language_1995}),\footnote{
          %   This seems to be a change in progress as \textcite{parr_glossary_1940} described it as ``rare'' (p.~xiii), but null object relatives appeared to be the norm for my participants.
          % } it was at times unclear whether a pronoun was the object of the main clause with an infinitive in the subordinate clause or the subject of a finite subordinate clause.

          % \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
          %   \item Quand li'tait dit nous-autres pour fait des affaires... (Floyd Kerry, 14:34)
          %   \item[] \gloss{When she would tell us to do things...}
          %   \item {}[quand li'tait dit nous-autres [pour fait des affairs]]
          %   \item {}[quand li'tait dit]
          % \end{enumerate}

          % Some subordinate clause pronouns are excluded, especially for Creole-oriented speakers, because it is unclear whether the subordinate verb is finite or not.
            % This is often the case when pour is used between clauses, a situation that is difficult to analyze (Rottet 1995:274-276)
            % e.g., "quand li'tait dit nous-autres pour fait des affaires" (Floyd Kerry:14:34)
              % [quand li'tait dit nous-autres [pour fait des affaires]]
              % [quand li'tait dit [nous-autres pour fait des affaires]]
    
    \subsection{Predicates following the pronoun}
      % Nouns, adjectives, and prepositions were removed for modeling due to low counts causing the models to not converge. Update this section with that in mind.
      As briefly discussed in section \ref{sec:pronoun_structure}, the type of verb that follows a subject pronoun has previously been found to impact subject pronoun realization, particularly for 3pl pronouns.
      The data here was thus coded for not only the verb type but the predicate type as there is not always a finite verb in a finite clause, and here I am counting the copula as a verb.
      It should also be noted that the \lexi{predicate} is used here as shorthand for the word following the subject pronoun.
      Auxiliary verbs are obviously not predicates, but their presence or absence does appear to be more important for subject pronoun realization than the actual predicates that follow them.
      The levels used for predicate time here include \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[1]}, \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[2]}, \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[3]}, \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[4]}\footnote{
        While a preposition itself would be difficult to categorize as a predicate, a prepositional phrase is not, so the term \lexi{preposition} here is more accurately shorthand for \lexi{prepositional phrase}.
      }, \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[5]}, and \Sexpr{levels(tokens$PredType)[6]}.
      The most important of these levels is auxiliary verbs which I limit primarily to the copula (\lexi{être}), verbs that can also means \gloss{to have} (\lexi{avoir} and \lexi{gain}), and verbs that can also mean \gloss{to go} (\lexi{aller} but also some very rare tokens of \lexi{courir}, \lexi{gone}, and \lexi{venir}).
      These latter two were only coded as auxiliary when they were not in fact the main lexical verb in the clause but rather played only an auxiliary role.
      Previous studies and my own pilot study suggest that these specific auxiliaries have an impact on subject pronoun realization but not necessarily other auxiliaries, meaning those that always expressed capability or obligation.
      These latter auxiliaries were coded as modal rather than auxiliary.

      While most predicates were rather trivial to categorize, some notes should be taken for several choices.
      One such choice was how to deal with aggregating surface forms of predicates into underlying forms, which was relevant to the fact that the predicate itself was taken as a random effect as will be discussed further in section \ref{sec:analysis_methods}.
      Positing an underlying form in most cases meant recognizing the infinitive form of the verb being used.
      For example, [ɛ̃m], [ɛ̃mɛ], and [ɛ̃mɾɛ] were all treated as inflections of one underlying form: \lexi{aimer} \gloss{to like}.
      However, some speakers produce forms such as [lɛ̃m] rather than [ɛ̃m] meaning prothesis has taken place.
      Alternatively, some speakers produced forms such as [mɑ̃de] rather than [dəmɑ̃de] or [seje] rather than [aseje], demonstrating evidence of aphaeresis presumably for the verbs \lexi{demander} \gloss{to ask} and \lexi{essayer} \gloss{to try}, respectively.
      These were indeed coded as representing the same target verb, though in some cases there remained ambiguity, such as when speakers produced [mene] as this could be targeting \lexi{mener}, \lexi{amener}, or \lexi{emmener},\footnote{
        These are in fact fairly ambiguous even for speakers who produce a word-initial vowel as nasalization tendencies in Louisiana mean that the latter two would both likely be pronounced as [ɑ̃mne].
      } all of which have closely related semantics.
      In these cases, no process of aphaeresis was assumed to have taken place so that [mene] was coded as \lexi{mener}.
      Finally, not only were verbs subject to but also the preposition used to create progressive constructions which will be discussed more in section \ref{sec:preverbal_markers}.
      This could be realized as [ap], [pe], [ape], or [apre], all of which were coded as being forms of \lexi{après} due to their fairly transparent relationships to each other.

      For verbs that can, when used lexically, mean \gloss{to have} but which are otherwise auxiliaries, several factors had to be considered.
      One of those factors was deciding whether the auxiliary \lexi{avoir} was present at all in perfective past constructions where \lexi{avoir} is followed by a past participle that carries the lexical verbal information.
      With the pronoun \lexi{ça}, pronounced [sa], the inflection of \lexi{avoir} is [a], resulting in [sa a] or simply [sa].
      This could be interpreted as \sent{ç'a + participle} or \sent{ça + inflected verb homophonous with the participle}.
      The coding decision was thus based on the speaker's patterns elsewhere where such ambiguity is not present.
      If a speaker expressed perfective past consistently with the auxiliary \lexi{avoir}, it was assumed to be present with \lexi{ça} as the subject, and if a speaker consistently expressed the same with an inflected verb and no auxiliary, it was assumed that \lexi{avoir} was absent.
      Likewise, a construction such as \sent{il a appris} \gloss{he learned} could be pronounced along the lines of [il apɾi] where the presence of the auxiliary \lexi{a} is uncertain due to the participle \lexi{appris} beginning with the same sound.
      The presence or absence of \lexi{avoir} was also judged by the speaker's patterns elsewhere in these cases.
      
      A construction that implicates \lexi{avoir} in all varieties of French in the world is the existential \lexi{il y a} \gloss{there is/are}.
      Quite directly, this consists of the expletive subject pronoun \lexi{il}, the locative object pronoun \lexi{y}, and the verb \lexi{avoir} in some inflected form.
      In French outside of Louisiana as well as F\&C in Louisiana, the \lexi{il} can be elided so that [il i a] because [i a] or [ja].
      Unique to Louisiana, however, is the pronunciation [ina] or sometimes simply [na].
      In all cases, the verb \lexi{avoir} in existential constructions was coded as lexical as there is no additional verb attached to suggest an auxiliary function, but it was also necessary to decide whether [i] represented \lexi{il}, which commonly become [i] before consonants, or \lexi{y} as this impacted the coding of the pronoun as \lexi{il} or null.
      Whereas \textcite{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} assumed [i] to be \lexi{il} (p.~50), here it was treated as \lexi{y} as the former requires the additional assumption that either \lexi{y} becomes [n], a rather radical shift, or that a verb such as \lexi{navoir} exists, which an infinitive that has never to my knowledge been attested.
      The interpretation chosen here assumes only that a false liaison exists between \lexi{y} and \lexi{a}, false liaisons being a phenomenon that is common in Louisiana to begin with \parencite[p.~78]{papen_structural_1997}.
      Also supporting this interpretation is \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}'s (\citeyear{klingler_if_2003}) attestation of the form \lexi{y ena} (pp.~307-308).
      As no variety of F\&C has been said to place object pronouns before subject pronouns as would have to be the case for \lexi{y ena} if \citeauthor{smith_morphosyntactic_1994} (\citeyear{smith_morphosyntactic_1994}) interpretation were followed, this further suggests that the initial vowel of \lexi{ina} is not \lexi{il}.
      This leads to the conclusion that tokens of \lexi{ina} have a null expletive pronoun.

      There are also two constructions that express necessity using verbs with the lexical sense of \gloss{to have}.
      One of these is \lexi{avoir besoin} \gloss{to have need}.
      These are easily interpretable in a direct way as \lexi{besoin} \gloss{need} is something one can in fact have, hence the verb \lexi{avoir} was coded as lexical in these cases rather than modal despite the rather modal compositional sense.
      This is further supported by the fact that \lexi{besoin} is a noun rather than a verb for speakers who produce this phrase.
      Others, however, use \lexi{besoin} without any \lexi{avoir} or \lexi{gain}, as in sentence \ref{sent:floyd_besoin}.
      An elided verb was not assumed in these cases as only \lexi{être} has been documented as eliding.\footnote{
        It could perhaps be argued that perfective past when expressed with the so called long form verbs (see Tables \ref{tab:inflect_manger_sf} through \ref{tab:inflect_manger_lc}) is an example of an elided \lexi{avoir} or \lexi{gain}, but to my knowledge, there are no attestations of these verbs being used in that structural context to establish that an auxiliary verb is possible there.
      }
      Rather, these speakers seem to be have \lexi{besoin} in their mental grammars as a modal verb, which is how such tokens were coded.
      The other construction expressing necessity is \lexi{gain/avoir pour}, which is always followed by a non-finite verb.
      As this differs from \lexi{avoir besoin} in that it is not interpretable from its components and cannot be followed by a noun, it was treated as a modal verb.

      \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
        \item Mo besoin fais d'autre l'ouvrage dessus li. (Floyd Kerry, 4:58) \label{sent:floyd_besoin}
        \item[] \gloss{I need to do other work on it.}
      \end{enumerate}

      Other auxiliary verbs that are at times lexical and at other times auxiliary are those that express movement in their lexical forms.
      When followed by an non-finite verb in order to indicate future tense, \lexi{aller} \gloss{to go}, for instance, was coded as an auxiliary but otherwise as lexical.
      Also used to mean \gloss{to go} \parencite[p.~246]{klingler_if_2003}, \lexi{couru} has not been attested as an auxiliary to express future tense as \lexi{aller} can and so was coded only as lexical.
      It should be noted that F\&C speakers do produce constructions with \lexi{couru} that are similar to auxiliary functions expressing tense, such as in sentence \ref{sent:elizabeth_serial}, but these should be understood as serial-like constructions that simply express consecutive actions \parencite[pp.~311-312]{klingler_if_2003}.
      This was the case for almost all such verbs in the data here save for rare occurrences like that found in sentence \ref{sent:tracy_gone} where a future tense is clearly intended.
      The oddity of this phrase is highlighted, though, by the fact that such uses of \lexi{gone} are unattested in the literature.
      This example may even be a token of English \lexi{gon} as derived from \lexi{going to} \parencite{winford_origins_1998} rather than English \lexi{gone}.
      \lexi{Gone} also presents ambiguity in its uncertain status as an adjective preceded by an elided copula or as a verb in and of itself.
      Ultimately, tokens of \lexi{gone} were all coded as verbs because \lexi{gone} can appear in contexts where only a verbal element is possible, such as after the auxiliary verb \lexi{avoir} in sentence \ref{sent:verb_gone}, and because the low number of tokens of predicate adjectives would give potentially incorrect codings of \lexi{gone} as an adjective an outsized impact on statistical results, making coding it as a verb the more conservative approach.

      \begin{enumerate}[resume=sentences]
        \item Mo couru travailler pour des avocats. (Elizabeth Naquin, 9:32) \label{sent:elizabeth_serial}
        \item[] \gloss{I went to work for some lawyers.}
        \item Mo pas gone payer pour toi. (Tracy Roth, 33:13) \label{sent:tracy_gone}
        \item[] \gloss{I'm not going to pay for you.}
        \item Il a gone pour un mois. \parencite[p.~315]{valdman_dictionary_2010} \label{sent:verb_gone}
        \item[] \gloss{He went for a month.}
      \end{enumerate}

      The copula itself can is not always obligatory in Louisiana \parencite[pp.~292/331]{klingler_if_2003}.
      As it perhaps clear already, absent copulas were not coded as the predicate type but rather the word that was present was coded.
      Coding predicate adjectives, predicate mnouns, or predicate prepositional phrases in these contexts was done because these provide more new information, given that some findings have already been made that implicate the copula's effect on subject pronouns, while still not undermining the ability to analyze auxiliaries again here as many manifest tokens of \lexi{être} and other auxiliaries still occurred.

      Some other verbs could arguably be treated as something other than lexical but were still coded as such here.
      These includes \lexi{faire} in the construction \lexi{ça (se) fait}, used as a coordinating conjunction or as a discourse marker along the lines of English \lexi{so}, \lexi{savoir} \gloss{to know}, \lexi{connaître} \gloss{to know}, \lexi{penser} \gloss{to think}, \lexi{croire} \gloss{to believe}, and verbs of preference.
      \lexi{Ça (se) fait} has somewhat of a direct reading that is possible, at least when used as a conjunction, in that it can be understand as \gloss{that makes it so (that)}, which supports coding it as lexical, as well as its lack of a following infinitive or participle.
      Verbs expressing concepts such as \gloss{to know} and \gloss{to think} are very often followed by subordinate clauses and sometimes even non-finite verbs, making them superficially resemble modal auxiliaries but were ultimately coded as lexical given that they are never semantically deficient, always expressing that which can be read from their direct glosses.
      This is likewise the case for verbs of preference which are regularly found followed by infinitives and suggest a quasi-modal meaning.
      These were also coded as lexical, however, which should be especially uncontroversial when followed by noun phrases.

      A final note must be made about reflexive verbs and, more generally, object pronouns.
      Reflexive verbs can involve a preverbal reflexive pronoun which, when the auxiliary verb \lexi{avoir} is present, comes before the auxiliary, raising the question of whether the pronoun or the auxiliary should be coded as the predicate (\foreign{i.e.}, the following word).
      The choice here was to code the auxiliary in these cases and in fact in all cases where a preverbal object pronoun is present as these pronouns are semantically linked to the verbal element rather than the auxiliary.
      Relatedly, reflexive verbs are sometimes glossed as having senses distinct from their non-reflexive versions, which implicates the coding for the underlying form as predicates were modeled as random effects.
      In other words, whether \lexi{rappeler} \gloss{to call back/to remind} and \lexi{se rappeler} \gloss{to remember} should be treated as one underlying form or two was considered.
      This difference in glosses is generally superficial -- \gloss{to remind oneself} is \gloss{to remember} -- but the rather arbitrary decision to code them as two underlying forms was nonetheless taken.

      \subsubsection{Preverbal marker coding}
        \label{sec:preverbal_markers}
        What has been referred to in the literature on Louisiana Creole as preverbal markers can naturally appear as the predicates of subject pronouns, as well.
        As was discussed in section \ref{sec:french_vs_creole} with the example of [te], rather than being given the ill-defined lexical category of marker, they are here given lexical categories that match their functions starting with the assumption that those functions are no different than they are for their lexical sources.
        Save for, ironically, older work that took the same approach that is taken here \parencite{broussard_louisiana_1972, fortier_french_1884}, this is in contrast with all previous work on Louisiana Creole that treated these elements as markers \parencite{brandt_question_2020, klingler_louisiana_2006, marshall_louisiana_1987, neumann_creole_1985}, the almost equallty ill-defined term \lexi{particles} \parencite{tentchoff_speech_1977, wendte_chronotopic_2022}, or when using the term \lexi{auxiliary}, applied it equally to non-auxiliaries and auxiliaries \parencite{klingler_if_2003}.
        Features that have previously been described as markers that showed up in the data for the present study will thus be discussed in this section.

        All of the tense markers in Louisiana Creole can be sensibly analyzed as auxiliary verbs.
        Besides [te] for imperfective past, all the possible tense markers also include those for future tense: [va], [a], [ale], [sa], and [sra].
        Of these, [ale] only appeared when expressing future tense from the vantage point of the past, meaning it was being used as the auxiliary verb \lexi{aller} inflected for imperfective past which is perfectly normal in French varieties around the world.
        The markers [sa] and [sra] were also quite rare, but when they occurred, they were either identical to Standard French future inflections of \lexi{être} as in sentence \ref{sent:owen_sa} or were production errors as in sentence \ref{sent:steven_sra} which involved considerable hesitations and, while superficially having a form expected from Creole-oriented speakers, had a clearly different sense.
        The remaining [va] and [a] are likely the same form, the latter eliding [v], as this is both a common phenomenon in F\&C \parencite[p.~182]{blainey_first_2013} and is how previous they were analyzed in previous work \parencite{neumann_creole_1985}. % Find page in Neumann
        These were quite common in the speech of all participants as they are in varieties of French around the world and so were treated as auxiliary uses of \lexi{aller}.
        % Ale is common in St Tammany Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":260)

        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*, series=sentences]
          \item Li sa pas content. (Owen Webre, 65:25) \label{sent:owen_sa}
          \item[] Elle sera pas contente. (Standard French)
          \item[] \gloss{She won't be happy.}
          \item La langue sera devenir plus sophistiquée aujourd'hui. (Steven Marcel, 69:09) \label{sent:steven_sra}
          \item[] \gloss{The language would have become more more sophisticated today.}
        \end{enumerate}

        Elements used to primarily express mood likewise can reasonably be interpreted as verbs, and in fact have been interpreted as auxiliaries albeit not distinct from other auxiliaries.
        Those that are possible are [pe], [ve], [ole], and [se] along with its rare variant [sre] (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~261/275-276]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~220-226/231-233]{neumann_creole_1985}).
        The first two are equivalent to French \lexi{peux/peut} [pø] and \lexi{veux/veut} [vø], respectively, representing inflections of the modal auxiliary verbs \lexi{pouvoir} \gloss{to be able} and \lexi{vouloir} \gloss{to want}.
        These are both predictable from Louisiana Creole phonology where front rounded vowels in French have not retained their rounding in the Creole of many speakers \parencite[p.~143]{klingler_if_2003}.
        The form [ole] is also believed to be derived from \lexi{vouloir}, whereas [se] and [sre] have a fairly transparent connection with French \lexi{serait/serais/seraient} [s(ə)re] or [s(ə)rɛ], the latter being conditional inflections of the verb \lexi{être} \gloss{to be}.
        As these behave both syntactically and semantically as they would be expected to do in any French variety, they were analyzed as modal auxiliaries here.
        The only exception is the verb [ole] which is preceded by \lexi{pas} even in present habitual constructions where it would be followed by \lexi{pas} for non-Creole-oriented speakers.
        This idiosyncrasy is shared with the verbs [kone] \gloss{to know}, [gɛ̃] \gloss{to have}, and [kuri] \gloss{to go} (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~261/275-276]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[p.~320]{neumann_creole_1985}).
        Such exceptions for some of the most frequent words in the language are not surprising, however, as irregular constructions in all languages generally apply to the most frequent words and so are not taken here as undoing the analysis of these ``markers'' as verbs.

        The form [kapab] along with its variants [ka] and [kab] has previously been analyzed as an auxiliary, as well (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[p.~247]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~223]{neumann_creole_1985}), despite clear evidence that it acts as an adjective exactly as its source \lexi{capable} does in French varieties, as seen in sentences \ref{sent:kapab1_klingler} and \ref{sent:kapab2_klingler} taken from \textcite{klingler_if_2003}\footnote{
          The orthographic convention used by Klingler, reproduced here, is more or less in line with the IPA.
        }.
        In both of these sentences, the lack of an overt copula preceding [ka] may give one pause in interpreting [ka] as an adjective, but copula absence is common cross-linguistically.
        Otherwise, the Creole versions are practically identical to the French versions where \lexi{capable} is uncontroversially an adjective.
        It should again be noted that the above modal elements that were classified as auxiliaries in past analyses were not distinguished from other types of auxiliaries as will be done here, specifically grouping together the copula and the auxiliaries that gloss as \gloss{to have} (\foreign{i.e.}, \lexi{avoir} and \lexi{gain}) and distinguishing those from lexical verbs and modal auxiliaries expressing ability and desirability.
        % \textcite{neumann_creole_1985} explicitly acknowledged that [kapab] comes from the French \lexi{être capable [kapab(l)] de} \gloss{to be capable of} where it is an adjective expressing ability but did not explain how she established it rather as an auxiliary verb in Creole.
        % \textcite[p.~273]{klingler_if_2003}, on the other hand, relied on \citeauthor{valdman_creole_1978}'s (\citeyear[p.~223]{valdman_creole_1978}) criteria that an auxiliary can be followed by another verb but either cannot be followed by an NP to form a VP or has a sense distinct from any related ``verbe autonome\footnote{autonomous verb},'' by which I assume he meant lexical verb, or both.
        % Putting aside that this is not a particularly clear definition -- is the first criteria necessary or optional when the latter criteria are met, and what counts as a related verb? -- these criteria do not match any of the many definitional criteria in the literature summarized by \textcite[pp.~22-24]{heine_auxiliaries_1993} and in fact the criteria of not being followed by an NP is contradicted by several syntacticians.

        \end{enumerate}
  
        As for aspect, two markers have been discussed in the literature as being purely aspectual: [bɪn] and [ape] with its variants [ap] and [e] (\citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~255/262-263]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{neumann_creole_1985}, \citeyear[pp.~75/209/211]{neumann_creole_1985}).
        \textcite{klingler_if_2003} categorized both as markers only, whereas \textcite{neumann_creole_1985} did likewise for [ape] but only gave a brief mention of [bɪn] without any categorization at all, perhaps not deeming it very important given its English origin as she likewise did not include it in her glossary.
        While [bɪn] did not appear as a predicate here, [ape] did for both Creole-oriented and French-oriented speakers.
        Indeed, this is not a feature unique to Creole despite being absent in standard Hexagonal French.
        It has been used with its progressive function starting at least in 16th century French with the form \sent{être après V} \gloss{to be V-ing} \parencite[p.~56]{gougenheim_etude_1929} and continued to be used in French varieties in North America up to recent times (\citeauthor{posner_morphologie_1998}, \citeyear[p.~109]{posner_morphologie_1998}; \citeauthor{pusch_lexpression_2005}, \citeyear{pusch_lexpression_2005}) including in French-oriented speech in Louisiana (\citeauthor{lane_notes_1934}, \citeyear[pp.~328-329]{lane_notes_1934}; \citeauthor{papen_structural_1997}, \citeyear[p.~102]{papen_structural_1997}).
        Despite its analysis as a marker in Creole, however, it has consistently been described as a preposition in French varieties that use it to indicate progressive aspect \parencite{dostie_etre_2021, pusch_lexpression_2005} and so was treated as a preposition here.
        % It is used in Creole to express perfect aspect in a way that is very similar to the use of \lexi{been} in African-American English, where it has been described as an auxiliary verb \parencite{dayton_grammatical_1996}.
    
    \subsection{Analyses carried out}
        \label{sec:analysis_methods}

        To help better understand if subject pronouns can function as markers of Creole and/or Cajun identities, binomial and multinomial logistic regression models were built for each pronoun type.
        Binomial models were used when a pronoun type consisted of only two levels and multinomial when it consisted of more than two levels.
        While multinomial models are not common in the literature, they have been successfully deployed in previous work on Louisiana pronouns \parencite{gudmestad_variationist_2022}, and so were chosen here to avoid the need to choose which pronoun levels to aggregate together.

        While Table \ref{tab:pronouns_attested} showed all of the pronouns that appeared in the data here for each pronoun type, not all of these were used as levels due to some having extremely low counts.
        The pronoun \lexi{ça} was dropped from all pronoun types other than 3pl, demonstrative, and expletive.
        As discussed in section \ref{sec:pronoun_structure}, this pronoun is in most categories so semantically deficient that it can stand in as a resumptive pronoun for any referent.
        Its use for most pronoun types was thus relegated to no more than three tokens.
        Likewise, \lexi{nous-autres} and \lexi{vous-autres} each only appeared once as 1pl pronouns, \lexi{il} only appeared for a feminine referent twice, and \lexi{elle} only appeared for a masculine referent once, all of which were excluded for modeling purposes.
        Null pronouns appeared for several pronoun types but no more than four times for any other than 1sg and expletive and were therefore excluded from all but these latter two categories.
        The pronoun \lexi{li}, while common for 3sg in both genders, only had two tokens that were expletive and so were excluded from that pronoun type.
        Finally, impersonal pronouns raised a more difficult question with \lexi{vous}.
        While only one token of \lexi{vou} appeared and so could be easily excluded, there were \Sexpr{tablesProTypeAll$impersonal["vous"]} tokens of \lexi{vous}.
        As these were produced by three different speakers, they were ultimately included for modeling.

        Two pronoun types were unable to be modeled due to their very low frequencies in the data: 2sg.V and 2pl.
        These summed to \Sexpr{sum(tablesProTypeFinal$secondSgV)} and \Sexpr{sum(tablesProTypeFinal$secondPl)} tokens, respectively.
        Participants were often made aware that they were free to ask questions during interviews to help elicit second person pronouns, but as their interlocutor was myself, a sole non-senior person, there were few opportunities to use a V pronoun or a plural pronoun outside of reported speech when telling stories and translation tasks.
        On the other hand, 2sg.T pronouns were relatively common, at least to the extent that it could be established that a pronoun was meant to be understood as a T form (see section \ref{sec:pronoun_types} for discussion of this issue).
        Table \ref{tab:pronouns_modeled} provides a summary of pronoun types and their levels as used for modeling where the first level was coded as the reference level.

        Regardless of whether building a binomial or multinomial model, the same factors were used.
        In terms of an \code{R} formula, this looks like Equation \ref{eq:regression_model} where each factor has the levels shown in Table \ref{tab:predictor_levels}.
        Just as with each pronoun type, the first level for each factor is the reference level that was used.
        The only structural factor modeled was the predicate type as no other structures have previously been found to have an impact on subject pronoun realization.
        All other factors were social in nature, the most important of which was naturally what is called here ethnicity.
        It is worth repeating that this is more of an agnostically used term as the object under investigation in this study is whether Creole and Cajun constitute races in Louisiana (\foreign{i.e.}, whether they are racialized categories).
        The use of the term \lexi{ethnicity} in listing model factors is therefore not meant to represent a conclusion to this question.
        Relatedly, participants were also asked how they identify racially, but as this yielded a number of different responses with very low counts, self-identified race could not be included in models but did yield results worthy of discussion here.

        All social factors were discussed in section \ref{sec:participants}, but some additional notes can be made here.
        First, several social factors are very likely correlated.
        Those with a high attained education, for instance, are likely to have white collar jobs and also likely to have some experience with institutional instruction of French.
        Additionally, participants' F\&C background could cover several factor levels, but only those that appeared to be their primary context for the acquisition of F\&C were assigned to them in order to avoid having many different categories.
        In most cases, this meant coding their F\&C background as whereever their first exposure to F\&C occurred unless they explicitly described that time as not being where they truly started to use the language.
        For instance, Judy Soileau Courtade grew up with F\&C all around her -- and her parents only spoke F\&C before they went to school -- but she explained to me that she only began speaking the language at the age of 18 after marrying her bilingual husband and to be able to communicate with members of the community for work.
        For all but \Sexpr{nrow(participants[participants$`F&C Background` != "Naturalistic",])} participants, F\&C was initially acquired naturalistically, making this factor worth noting but inappropriate for modeling.
        Experience with institutional instruction of French (\foreign{i.e.}, Institutional French) was instead modeled.
        Only those with a college education had such experience, but not all those with a college education did.
        Finally, speaker and predicate were included as random effects as is standard for both.
        For predicates, this helps prevent having the results skewed by frequently repeated fixed phrases much like using word as a random effect when building models of variation in vowels.

        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*., ref=\roman*, series=equations]
          \item Pronoun Type $\sim$ Predicate Type + Ethnicity + Gender + Institutional French + Birth Year\footnote{
            For modeling, this factor was rescaled to avoid producing a very large effect size.

        A final two social factors were not modeled here but will be discussed whereas another was modeled here but will not be discussed until chapter \ref{chap:personal_networks}.
        The two unmodeled factors are place of residence and place where the participant was raised.
        Exact towns were recorded for all speakers for both of these factors, but even when aggregating by parish, the counts for each level were not high enough to reliably model.
        However, the results are interesting as-is and so will be shown with the caveat that no real conclusions can be drawn from them.
        The factor of IE ethnic homophily was modeled but will not be discussed in this chapter as this relates to the social network questions asked in the next chapter.
        The calculation for IE homophily as well as the explanation of why it was modeled as having an interaction with ethnicity will all be discussed there.

  \section{Results}
    \label{sec:pronoun_results}
    The question most central to the quantitative analyses carried out here is whether or not subject pronouns in F\&C act as markers for Creole and Cajun identities.
    In terms of racialization, such a result would suggest that speech can serve as a identifier with the potential to lead to acts of discrimination.
    Given that the analysis here treats all of the subject pronouns, it can also address the question of whether these pronouns covary, which would suggest that they form a whole system that distinguishes Creoles and Cajuns.
    The results do in fact lend quantitative support to the idea that subject pronouns vary according to Creole and Cajun identities, but there are some other results worth noting in this section beforehand.
    The full summary read-outs for each model are given in Appendix \ref{app:code}.

    Only one pronoun type did not yield any statistically significant results when modeled, that being 3sg.M.
    This variable consisted of \lexi{li} compared to the reference level \lexi{il}.
    Two factors did, however, approach significance -- ethnicity ($P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$thirdSgM$coefficients["li~EthnicityCajun", "Pr(>|z|)"])}) and exposure to institutional French ($P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$thirdSgM$coefficients["li~`Institutional French`Yes", "Pr(>|z|)"])}) -- both of which proved to be important factors in subject pronoun realization overall, as will be seen.
    While the odds were higher that participants would produce \lexi{li} with factors at the reference levels of Creole for ethnicity and no institutional French exposure (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$thirdSgM$coefficients["li~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}), being Cajun and being exposed to institutional French both lowered the odds considerably (estimate $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$thirdSgM$coefficients["li~EthnicityCajun", "Estimate"])} and estimate $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$thirdSgM$coefficients["li~`Institutional French`Yes", "Estimate"])}, respectively).
    Again, although these results are not statistically significant, they do align with expectations.
    The literature has by and large only included analyses of \lexi{li} when conceptualized as studies specifically of the language variety Louisiana Creole, so for Creoles to veer towards \lexi{li} and Cajuns towards \lexi{il} is reasonable.
    In terms of exposure to institutional French, one can safely assume that \lexi{li} would never be brought up in a French classroom -- and a Louisiana Creole language classroom has never existed to my knowledge -- whereas \lexi{il} is plainly the norm, so it likewise makes sense for those who have not been in a classroom to feel free to use \lexi{li} and for those who may have felt pressure to adapt to classroom French to use \lexi{il}.
    
    % Gender was the only non-significant factors
      % Close to significance for expletive null > ça
    Similarly to only one response variable having significant factors, only one factor was not significant for any pronoun types: gender.
    This was clearly the case even just from examining the raw count distributions for each pronoun type.
    Only for 3pl did it appear that women may have been behaving the differently than men.
    As Figure \ref{fig:gender_3pl}, the use of \lexi{yé} relative to \lexi{ils} appears to be quite different for the two groups.
    However, the reference level was \lexi{ça}, from which both groups show an increase of counts for \lexi{yé}.
    Furthermore, 3pl \lexi{ça} and \lexi{ils} likely form a system, as will be seen, and when collapsing these two pronouns as in Figure \ref{fig:gender_3pl_collapsed}, both men and women seem to follow a very similar pattern.
    For expletive pronouns, gender did approach statistical significance with the odds of producing \lexi{ça} over a null pronoun even lower for women than for men (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["ça~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}; estimate $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["ça~GenderWoman", "Estimate"])}; $P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["ça~GenderWoman", "Pr(>|z|)"])}), but the distribution similarities in Figure \ref{fig:gender_expl} suggest that this was coincidental rather than a slightly underpowered statistical analysis.
    Indeed, no participants ever explicitly brought up differences in the speech of men versus women, allowing for a safe conclusion that gender is not an important factor for subject pronoun realization in F\&C.

    Only one structural factor, that of following verb, was included in the models, but it did yield the result that was expected from previous studies as well an unexpected result, all of which are summarized in Table \ref{tab:verb_results}.
    What was expected was that the odds of producing \lexi{ils} for 3pl rather than \lexi{ça} would increase before auxiliary verbs, meaning \lexi{être}, \lexi{avoir}, and \lexi{aller},\footnote{
      The verbs \lexi{courir}, \lexi{venir}, \lexi{gone} and in some instances \lexi{gain} were also treated as auxiliaries but were so rare in this function that they did not appear after 3pl subject pronouns.
    } forming a system where there are \lexi{ils/ça} users and then \lexi{yé} users.
    This effect had been seen in previous studies \parencite{brown_pronominal_1988, byers_defining_1988}.
    As Figure \ref{fig:3pl_predtype} shows, before auxiliaries, \lexi{ça} is essentially unheard of.
    Of those tokens of \lexi{ça} that were produced before auxiliaries, most were produced before \lexi{aller} (\Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "ça" & tokens$PredUnder == "aller",])} out of \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "ça",])}) in contrast to the rarity of \lexi{ils} before \lexi{aller} (\Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "ils" & tokens$PredUnder == "aller",])} out of out of \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "ils",])}) and even the rarity of \lexi{yé} before \lexi{aller} (\Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "yé" & tokens$PredUnder == "aller",])} out of out of \Sexpr{nrow(tokens[tokens$ProType == "3pl" & tokens$PredType == "auxiliary" & tokens$ProUnder == "yé",])}).
    The implication is that the truly important verbs are \lexi{être} and \lexi{avoir} but not \lexi{aller}.
    The verb type that would include the two former and exclude the latter is not entirely clear, however.

    A somewhat unexpected structural result was that the odds of producing \lexi{je} for 1sg were higher before auxiliaries than \lexi{mo} (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["mo~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}; coefficient $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["mo~PredTypeauxiliary", "Estimate"])}; $P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["mo~PredTypeauxiliary", "Pr(>|z|)"])}) or a null pronoun (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["ø~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}; coefficient $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["ø~PredTypeauxiliary", "Estimate"])}; $P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$firstSg$coefficients["ø~PredTypeauxiliary", "Pr(>|z|)"])}) as this is not a constraint that had been previously found.
    The most thorough structural investigation of 1sg subject pronouns, \textcite{gudmestad_variationist_2022}, looked at phonetic variation rather than lexical variation as is done here.
    They examined verb inflection classes rather than the lexical categories of verbs and had mixed results.
    Null pronouns were more likely than the [ʃ] realization of \lexi{je} before \lexi{-er} verbs but less likely than the [ʒ] realization in the same context (pp.~14-15).\footnote{
      While they did also look at \lexi{mo}/\lexi{moi}, it was somewhat tangential as it is not a phonetic variant of \lexi{je}.
    }
    The present study thus adds to the overall picture for structural variation of 1sg subject pronouns in Louisiana and to null pronouns in general.
    Indeed, a pattern found in studies of null pronouns in other languages -- generally fully pro-drop languages -- is that null pronouns are less likely in linguistic contexts where the verbal morphology does not completely disambiguate the subject on its own \parencite{hochberg_functional_1986}, but for the speakers in the present data, the verbal morphology is more fleshed out for auxiliary verbs than non-auxiliaries, yet it was these latter verbs that led to more null 1sg pronouns.

    For social factors, it should be noted that none were correlated with each other to an extent that would perhaps warrant their removal.
    The generalized VIF values (\foreign{i.e.}, $GVIF^{1/2*df}$) for all factors in all models were easily below 5.
    This was true despite some factors being logically correlated.
    For instance, older individuals are more likely to be retired in general and those with college educations are more likely to have White collar jobs.
    None of this appeared to make the models any more difficult to interpret, regardless.
    
    % Education, on the other hand, had predictive value for expletive subject pronouns and impersonal subject pronouns.
    % Those with college educations were less likely to produce \lexi{il} for expletives than a null pronoun (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["il~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}, coefficient $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["il~EducationCollege Graduate", "Estimate"])}, $P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$expletive$coefficients["il~EducationCollege Graduate", "Pr(>|z|)"])}) and were far more likely to prodouce \lexi{to} for impersonal pronouns than \lexi{tu} (intercept $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$impersonal$coefficients["to~(Intercept)", "Estimate"])}, coefficient $\approx$ \Sexpr{Round(logitModelSummaries$impersonal$coefficients["to~EducationCollege Graduate", "Estimate"])}, $P <$ \Sexpr{Ceiling(logitModelSummaries$impersonal$coefficients["to~EducationCollege Graduate", "Pr(>|z|)"])}).
    % One might expect the opposite result for expletives as \lexi{il} is normative in classroom language learning situations, and as Figure \ref{fig:education_by_institutionalFr} shows, only those participants who went to college had any such experience.
    % This expectation fails to be met even more so with impersonal pronouns as in fact neither \lexi{to} nor \lexi{tu} but rather \lexi{on} are normative in the classroom, which was so infrequent as an impersonal pronoun in the data for this study that it could not be included in the model.
    % Anecdotally, it is not uncommon for students to transfer impersonal English \lexi{you} to the French classroom and produce \lexi{tu} or \lexi{vous} for impersonal expressions.
    % In either case, speakers in the present data did not transfer their experience with classroom French into the language they used during interviews.

    % The above social factors did not consistently prove to be statistically significant predictors of subject pronoun realization.
    % Occupation type, however, was significant for almost all pronoun types, as shown in Table \ref{tab:occupation_results}.
    % Only 3sg masculine and feminine are absent, as they are for all factors, and 1pl did not quite reach the level of statistical significance.
    % For 3pl, the only significant result was \lexi{yé} being dispreferred relative to \lexi{ça} for white collar workers whereas occupation type had no predictive value for the use of \lexi{ils} relative to \lexi{ça}.
    % As discussed above, \lexi{ils} and \lexi{ça} seem to form a system constrained by verb type, and so it is not surprising that they would vary in tandem when considering social factors.
    % Overall, white collar workers were more likely to use many of the pronouns that align with Hexagonal French: \lexi{je}, \lexi{tu} for 2sg.T, and \lexi{on} for 1pl.
    % Likewise, they were more likely to produce \lexi{il} as an expletive pronoun, although \lexi{ça} was also much more highly preferred than a null pronoun, this latter form being unattested in other French varieties for this function to the best of my knowledge.
    % \lexi{Ça} was also preferred for 3pl by white collar workers, which is perhaps the result that most distinguishes their pronoun use from that of francophones in other parts of the world.
    % What is striking about this result is not that white collar speakers prefer more standard language but rather that previous descriptions of F\&C in Louisiana have foregone any attempt to examine socioeconomic class with the argument that there was no meaningful stratification in these communities.
    % While occupation type is not equivalent to socioeconomic class in and of itself, it can certainly factor into the socioeconomic equation, suggesting that this may be a worthwhile avenue of study in F\&C going forward.

    % Ethnicity
      % This was the factor that would suggest that pronouns are indexical of racialized identities but was not a significant factor for any pronoun type save for expletive
        % dispreferred il over null for expletives
      % However, in all cases, the coefficients did reproduce the way Louisianians TALK about differences in the speech of Creoles and Cajuns
        % Cajuns were...
        % ..less likely to produce mo over je
        % ..less likely to produce to over tu for 2sg.T
        % ..less likely to produce li over elle for 3sg.F
        % ..less likely to produce li over il for 3sg.M
        % ..slightly less likely to produce no over on
        % ..less likely to produce ye over ils and ils over ca
        % ..less likely to produce to over tu for impersonal
        % These are the sort of patterns Cajun participants produced when they discussed Creoles speaking differently
          % Of course, these same participants at times made it clear that Cajuns talk like Creoles sometimes and Creoles talk like Cajuns, so while there seem to be stereotypes about the speech of each group, the reality of how actual language use patterns doesn't support these stereotypes to the extent that even those who hold the stereotypes recognize that

    % For an exploratory analysis: let's look at how occupation and ethnicity interact
      % After all, the tendencies, though again not significant, align with occupation type tendencies which were significant
        % Almost all Cajuns were White collar but just under half of Creoles were White collar
        % However, none of the non-White Collar Cajuns produced any of the traditionally "Louisiana Creole" pronouns
          % The two Cajuns who did so regularly and one who demonstrated his ability to speak "Kouri-Vini" were all White Collar
      % But let's look
        % Models with just this interaction tend to fail to converge due to cells with low or zero counts
        % What can be see consistently in simple bar plots, though, is that blue collar Creoles always favor traditional Creole pronoun variants much more than any other subsection of the participants
        % This seems to suggest that there is a pronoun system that's indexical of blue collar Creoles that is carried over as a stereotype for all Creoles, but the models of the data here do not support that
          % Perhaps a larger sample of speakers is needed to draw such a conclusion quantitatively

    % Finally, what about race?
      % Racial self-identifications are generally associated with ethnic identities
        % Notably, one cannot claim a Black, AA, or Creole racial identity while also claiming a Cajun identitiy
      % What do some pronoun distributions look like for Black/AA vs White/Caucasian compared to Creole vs Cajun?

    % And what about the non-modeled pronouns?

  \section{Discussion}
    \label{sec:pronoun_discussion}
    % Are the markers of Creoles and Cajuns?
      % Subject pronouns are certainly not indicators much less markers in Labov's (1972 "Sociolinguistic Patterns":237) sense as that would require some clear differentiation in use (i.e., production) between Creoles and Cajuns
      % It is also hard to say that subject pronouns are indexical in the sense of indexical orders (Silverstein 2003; Johnstone & Kiesling 2008) as these are also implicitly related to regular associations between groups of speakers and linguistic forms
      % Subject pronouns may, however, be markers or signifiers of Creole and Cajun identities in the sense used in the literature on race (e.g., Fassin 2011:420; Holt 1995:3).
        % In this sense, a feature, linguistic or otherwise, must simply be associated with a group that is racialized
        % Quantitatively, this is not well supported here, but as we'll see in chapter 5, it is a recurring theme in the discourse of Louisianians
    
    % How might subject pronouns be markers of Creole and Cajun identities without being quantitatively associated with these groups in a robust way?
      % Subject pronouns were more neatly divided between Creoles and Cajuns in the past
        % This is unlikely since it has always


    % The principle of multiple causes is the idea that more than one factor influences language variation patterns (Bayley 2002, as cited in Hazen 2014:12)
      % This does not only mean that multiple identified factors are at work but that unindentified factors may also be at work
    % Dying languages are expected to show 1) reduction/simplification, 2) stylistic shrinkage, 3) increased variability, and 4) rapid change (Dressler 1972; Dorian 1989; O'Shannessy 2011; Palosaari & Campbell 2011; Schmidt 1985; Wolfram 2004, all as cited in Carmichael & Gudmestad 2019:72)
      % Sasse (1992), with examples, suggested that dying language show extreme phonological variation (as cited in Rottet 1995:49)
      % Dorian (1981) argued that speakers of dying languages have greater tolerance for variations as there are no longer ideal language users to emulate and therefore no standard (as cited in Rottet 1995:38)
        % However, Schmidt (1985) reported older speakers of Dyirbal correcting younger speakers despite it being a dying language (as cited in Rottet 1995:38)
      % Rottet (1995) speculated dying languages would be "in flux in far more ways" than healthy languages, even though the changes are the same (313)
      % Dorian (1994 "Varieties") has argued that variation is socially neutral in endangered languages in the sense that it exists but doesn't mean anything to speakers (as cited in Mayeux 2024 "Racial":28)
    % Style shifting in the pronouns used by participants
      % Second repertoire acquisition is defined as the acquisition of a new set of features due to their indexing a change in some aspect of one's identity at some point in life (Benor 2010:167-168)
        % One of the clearest examples Owen Webre who had experience as a French teacher, which may have been the addition of more complexity to his linguistic identity
    % Social meaning
      % Bell (1984) argued that most variables are markers (152)
      % Benor (2010) argued that the social meaning of language variation "changes according to context, and it is negotiated in interactions" (160)
      % It has been argued that speakers, whether consciously or not, use language variation to either align themselves with or distinguish themselves from others (Benor 2010:160; Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985)
      % Sharma (2011) claimed the variationist approach to social meaning assumes that a single variable in correlation with "macrosocial factors" explains its meaning (465)
