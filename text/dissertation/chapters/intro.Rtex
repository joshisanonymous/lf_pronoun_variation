\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{chap:intro}
  The idea of Louisiana in the public imagination is most often rather that of South Louisiana and the New Orleans metropolitan area as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mapacadiana} where the highlighted area is of the traditional French speaking parishes (i.e., counties) of South Louisiana.
  Indeed, the boundary between North and South Louisiana is traditionally a division in culinary practices, religion, and language \parencite[p.~309]{trepanier_french_1988}, where those cultural features that most distinguish Louisiana from the rest of the Deep South are those of South Louisiana.
  The language of North Louisiana, for example, has historically been English rather than French and Creole \parencite[p.~265]{gold_french_1979}, and the most prominent religion has historically been Protestant Christianity rather than Catholicism.
  At times, this difference in religious beliefs has even been significant enough that Northerners have been described as ``rabid anti-Catholic Protestants'' \parencite[p.~27]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
  This has led to a situation where South Louisiana locals will even sometimes derisively refer to North Louisiana as ``South Arkansas'', a reference to the perceived indistinguishability of North Louisiana from the rest of the mostly Anglo, Protestant American South.

  For sociolinguists, the two major social categories, Creole and Cajun constitute a major point of interest in South Louisiana.
  As will be discussed in Sections \ref{sec:creole_history} and \ref{sec:cajun_history}, the definitions for these two categories each have rather winding histories.
  For \lexi{Creole}, the term has referred to various groups based on country of origin and/or skin color, ending up as a something of a synonym for Black for many people today, though the modern-day use of the term certainly maintains some variability.
  For \lexi{Cajun}, what started as a term referring to the Acadian diaspora in Louisiana has morphed to refer to people from various backgrounds with the notable restriction that Cajun and Black identities are mutually exclusive.
  These categories were initially born out of Louisiana's history as a French and Spanish colony before becoming part of the United States, and as such, maintain a regional uniqueness while also coming to be influenced by the racialized social system \parencite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} of the broader US.
  Indeed, the aim of the present study is to better understand if and in what ways Creole and Cajun identities have become racialized \parencite{omi_racial_2015}.
  
  Of more purely linguistic interest, language is a distinguishing feature of South Louisiana in that there is a history of Creoles and Cajuns speaking French and Creole (F\&C)\footnote{
    \lexi{F\&C} will be used as an umbrella term in this study for all French-related language varieties spoken in South Louisiana, as will be discussed further in Section \ref{sec:french_vs_creole}.
  }.
  Today, these languages are spoken in South Louisiana as heritage languages, whereas they were the dominant languages perhaps as recently as the mid 20th century.
  Indeed, by the 1980s, South Louisiana was still being described as ``un exemple par excellence d'une société multilingue''\footnote{
    An ideal example of a multilingual society.
  } \parencite[p.~16]{neumann_creole_1985}.
  F\&C in Louisiana are unique cultural resources that are generally valued by many among the populace and even exploited for commercial gain, but both are on the decline.
  Both have been documented as showing variation along geographic and social dimensions, as will be discussed in Sections \ref{sec:participants} and \ref{sec:pronoun_system}, though recent work focusing on ethnic and/or racial variation in and around the Lafayette area, the geographic focus of this study, is lacking.
  Furthermore, while sociological and anthropological work on race has begun to inform work in sociolinguistics since \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, there still remains ample room in the field for studying racialization.
  Combining this gap in the descriptive literature on F\&C with the need for more analyses of racialization from a sociolinguistic perspective, the objective of this dissertation is thus to examine how the social categories Creole and Cajun relate to race.
  Chapter \ref{chap:pronoun_variation} will analyse subject pronoun usage to establish whether these function as markers of Creole and Cajun identity.
  Chapter \ref{chap:personal_networks} will look at the personal social networks of participants to understand whether there is segregation, homophily, and along what lines as the existence of such attributes of social structures can be an indicator of a racialized social system \parencite[pp.~517-518]{bonilla-silva_what_2021}.
  Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:ethnic_race_meaning} will examine how participants spoke about their language and identities in terms of race and ethnicity to determine if their lived experiences are indicative of those of racialized peoples.

  \section{Race and ethnicity}
    \label{sec:race_ethnicity}
    As Decker (1994) suggested, when using race in sociological research, it is important to explicitly define \lexi{race} in order to make clear how it is being used \parencite[as cited in][p.~22]{omi_racial_1997}.
    This is especially true in the present study where the goal is to understand if \lexi{Creole} and \lexi{Cajun} are ethnic categories or racialized categories.
    The following is thus not only an explanation of how the concept of race will be used throughout this dissertation but also how it contrasts with ethnicity.

    Early conceptualizations of race and ethnicity in the social sciences were relatively straight forward but often problematic, as well, especially in the case of race.
    Indeed, early attempts at outlining taxonomies of race, such as \citeauthor{blumenbach_natural_1865}'s (\citeyear{blumenbach_natural_1865}), were inherently racist, and unsurprisingly, always placed Whites/Europeans at the top of the hierarchy \parencite[Eze, 1997, as cited in][p.~654]{hesse_racialized_2007}.
    Later definitions did not give race a much better treatment, even when provided by prominent sociologists.
    \textcite{weber_economy_1978}, for instance, defined race as ``common inherited and inheritable traits that actually derive from common descent'' arising when a ``common trait'' is highlighted due to an antagonistic relationship with those having an ``obviously different'' trait (p.~385).
    While this definition incorporates the idea of conflict, which is readily apparent in modern views of race, it remains essentialist in character in that race is a seen as a fact of nature.

    On the other hand, early definitions of ethnicity were not particularly problematic for espousing harmful views -- intentionally or not -- but were instead inconsistent.
    For instance, while \textcite{weber_economy_1978} defined ethnic groups as ``groups that entertain subjective belief in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration'' (389), Huxley and Haddon (1935) used the term as a substitute for race to identify groups at the national level \parencite[as cited in][pp.~481-482]{banton_ethnic_2000}, and a bit later \textcite{gans_symbolic_1979} implicitly defined ethnic groups in terms of immigration, giving Jewish people, Catholics, and Italians as examples in the US.
    Perhaps the most general of these earlier definitions was that proposed by Moerman (1965) first in his work on the Lue in Thailand \parencite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010} and later echoed by others (\foreign{e.g.}, \citeauthor[Giles, 1979, as cited in][]{le_page_acts_1985}, \citeyear[p.~2]{le_page_acts_1985}; \citeauthor{le_page_acts_1985}, \citeyear[p.~2]{le_page_acts_1985}).
    He defined an ethnic group as those individuals who perceive themselves as belonging to the same ethnic category.
    Portions of these definitions of ethnicity are still found in modern definitions, though in the case of Weber's, the involvement of colonization has become central to definitons of race rather than ethnicity.

    These definitions of ethnicity also suggest that there has always been some indecision over whether to treat race and ethnicity as separate analytical concepts or not, and by the 2000s, some had maintained a a distinction between them while others had not or had at least treated it as a blurry distinction \parencite[p.~25]{brubaker_ethnicity_2009}.
    \textcite{loveman_is_1999}, for instance, who proposed abandoning the distinction, argued that the distinction between race and ethnicity is born out of the context of the US and so is not generalizable (p.~891), while \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} argued instead that the distinction is important, stating that  ``[e]thnicity has a primarily sociocultural foundation, and ethnic groups have exhibited tremendous malleability in terms of who belongs,'' whereas races are ``initially ... imposed externally to justify the collective exploitation of a people and are maintained to preserve status differences'' (p.~469).
    He thus later pointed to colonialism as the origin of race and the formation of nation-states as the origin of ethnicity \parencite[pp.~902-903]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999}, colonialism naturally not being relegated to the US.
    Indeed, \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017} implicitly agreed when they suggested that studies of race should not be relegated to just the US since European colonialism did not occur exclusively in the US (pp.~634-635).
    It is perhaps because of influential work on race of people like Bonilla-Silva's that \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010}, working on ethnicity, revised his earlier view from conceptualizing race and ethnicity as equivalent to treating them as distinct (p.~8).

    For both race and ethnicity, a common thread in their conceptualizations is the idea of contact between groups.
    Indeed, in the case of ethnicity, \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010} argued that a group sees itself as an ethnic group only when there is contact with other such groups and those groups see each other as different despite similarities or differences in their respective cultures (p.~16)
    This is thought of as making such identities salient where they once were not, which is perhaps the reason that the origin of ethnicities lies in the late 18th century with ``European processes of transition from sovereign states into nation-states and to immigration of `nationals' to foreign lands'' \parencite[A. D. Smith, 1986, as cited in][p.~903]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999}.
    This results in modern definitions such as an ethnic group being any ``named human populations with shared ancestry myths, histories and cultures, having an association with a specific territory and a sense of solidarity'' \parencite[p.~27]{guibernau_ethnic_1997}, the implication being that those histories and ideas of territory become more important to people when they are more at risk of losing them after immigrating.
    This would also be true of similar though more cognitive definitions of ethnicity such as ``a social and cognitive structure that leads people to recognize themselves and/or be recognized by others as having real or putative common ancestry, shared culture, and/or a shared historical past'' \parencite[Brubaker et al., 2004; Cronell \& Hartmann, 1998, as cited in][p.~41]{roth_conceptualizations_2023}.
    That which one ends up with is the idea that ethnicity is about belief in a shared history of some sort that is brought to the forefront through contact with others.
    % Modern view of ethnicity (simple)  
      % Various dichotomies in how ethnicity is conceptualized
        % Essentialist vs constructivist, primordialist vs instrumentalist, perennialist vs modernist (Wimmer 2013:1)
      % Primary vs secondary ethnicity
        % Both are based on shared sentiment of belonging together and collective action, but primary is a group that constitutes a sovereign political unit and secondary that constitutes a subdivision within a sovereign political unit (Banton 2000:482)
      % Brubaker (2009) summarized how race had been distinguished from ethnicity along 7 race-to-ethnicity dimensions: 1) involuntary ; voluntary 2) externally assigned; internal self-assigned 3) based on phenotype or nature; based on culture 4) rigid ; flexible 5) hierarchical ; coordinated 6) exclusive ; inclusive 7) a result of colonialism ; a result of nation-state formation (25-26)
        % His position was that neither race nor ethnicity are good analytical concepts in the sense of them representing bounded and solidary groups (Brubaker 2009:27-28) thought he did think ethnicity has a cognitive existence
          % This stance is perhaps supported by the concept of symbolic ethnicity where ethnic identities are no longer about organizing but instead on finding individualized ways to simple feel one's ethnicity (Gans 1979)

    In the case of race, not only is contact involved in modern definitions but also conflict.
    \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}, for instance, defined a race as a group that is the effect of ``practices of opposition'' between it and another group ``at the economic, political, social, and ideological levels,'' which is ``usually, although not always,'' tied to concepts of the human body \foreign{post hoc} (p.~472).
    Although some still give the body as the primary trait to which racial categories are attached to \parencite[\foreign{e.g.}][pp.~6-7]{susberry_racial_2004}, the key aspect of the above definition is that this association is only made after a group has already been labeled as a race to justify actions against said group.
    Groups that have been racialized can be marked by appearance but also by language, religion, or culture, as well \parencite[pp.~636-637]{grosfoguel_racism_2015}.
    Examples of racialized peoples thus include Jewish people in Europe, the Irish in England, and American Indians in the US \parencite[p.~472]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
    This is why \textcite{grosfoguel_race_2004} warned that too much focus on color categories obscures ``other forms of racialization'' (p.~326), and \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, speaking of both race and language, argued that studies of these subjects should not begin with ``racialized bodies and communicative practices'' as this limits one's ability to see how these categories ``become racially and linguistically legible,'' meaning that analyses must start with historical and institutional contexts instead (p.~637).
    % Modern view of race
      % Some continue to think of race in terms of bodies
        % "'[A] concept which signifies and symbolizes social conflicts and interests by referring to different types of human bodies'" (Omi & Winant 1994, as cited in Fought 2013:388)
          % Bonilla-Silva (1997) cites Omi and Winant (1986) [just a different edition] as defining race as the outcome of the process of "'the extension of racial meaning to a previously racially unclassified relationship, social practice or group'" (471), which isn't focusing so heavily on bodies.
        % Both of these definitions place conflict at the center of race
      % Definition
        % This can be based on physical attributes
          % Light-skinned Europeans arrived in the US being classified as "not-yet White" only to become "White" but "ethnic" still after a short time (Roediger 1994, as cited in Bonilla-Silva 1997:472)

    The historical context for race is colonialism.
    As \textcite{hesse_racialized_2007} argued, race as it exists today is not about bodies but rather about Europeanness vs non-Europeanness (p.~646), which led him to propose the idea of racialized modernity as he viewed modernity as going hand in hand with the development of the concept of Europe versus non-Europe that became symbolized as race.
    Likewise, the naturalization of languages with races was part of this \parencite[p.~623]{rosa_unsettling_2017}.
    While Hesse's focus was more generally on modernity, colonialism was a major component of this process as it brought about the possibility of enrichment through the exploitation of Others.
    Indeed, \textcite{grosfoguel_race_2004} similarly stated that Europeans and non-Europeans were the two groups involved in the ``global racial/ethnic hierarchy'' and that this hierarchy stems from the capitalist world economy (p.~320), again eluding to the motivation for results of colonialism.

    Without the presence of resources that one population wishes to monopolize, as with colonialism, there is little in the way of motivation for any form of rational racism.
    This is why \textcite{ray_theory_2019} defined race as ``a relationship between persons'' constructed through ``the distribution of social, psychological, and material resources'' (p.~29).
    It is through the desire to control the distribution of resources that racial schema are activated and then attached to those resources \parencite[p.~32]{ray_theory_2019}.
    For example, only because access to education exists is the access to that education partitioned along racialized lines in order to help one population maintain its privileged position with respect to this resource.
    Once racialized, race becomes a form of capital where the dominant, unmarked population wields more power.
    In the case of the US then, Whiteness has been described as a form of property ``encompassing `all of a person's legal rights''' \parencite[Harris, 1995, as cited in][p.~30]{ray_theory_2019}.
    One's race comes to be used to determine expectations in social interactions where those of the subordinated race are always in need of first overcoming those expectations.
    This difference in prejudice is much of what defines the sort of privilege experienced by those of the superordinate race.
    % Importantly, this was born with colonialism or colonial-like activities
      % Lenin (1916) had also suggested that colonialism existed as least as far back as Rome, which he argued was built on slavery (as cited in Wolpe 1975:113), (probably accidentally) making the connection between colonialism and race
      % Casanova (1965) argued that "[r]acism and racial discrimination are the historical legacy of the conquest of some peoples by others, from antiquity to the expansion of the great empires and colonial systems of the modern era" (31)
        % This presages later work on racial formation but also characterizes colonialism as more than just the European activities since the 15th century

    The process of creating racial categories in the first place is known as racial formation, defined as ```the sociohistorical process by which racial categories are created, inhabited, transformed, and destroyed''' \parencite[Omi \& Winant, 1986, as cited in][p.~466]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
    European colonialism is commonly cited as the exact colonial period through which this sociohistorical process played out (\citeauthor[Boggs, 1970; Cox, 1948; Furnivall, 1948; Bagubane, 1990; E. Williams, 1944/1961; R. Williams, 1990, as cited in][]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}, \citeyear[p.~473]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}; \citeauthor[Stoler, 1995, as cited in][]{rosa_unsettling_2017}, \citeyear[p.~623]{rosa_unsettling_2017}) and sometimes specifically colonialism in the Americas \parencite[Quijano, 1993, as cited in][p.~326]{grosfoguel_race_2004}.
    However, the racialization of people is a possible result of any colonial enterprise.
    Indeed, as \textcite{casanova_internal_1965} argued before the racial formation perspective was developed, ``Racism and racial discrimination are the historical legacy of the conquest of some peoples by others, from antiquity to the expansion of the great empires and colonial systems of the modern era'' (p.~31).
    Even earlier, Lenin (1916) described Rome as partaking in colonialism, furthermore stating that it was built on slavery \parencite[as cited in][p.~113]{wolpe_theory_1975}, which suggests the same circumstances that propelled racial formation during European colonialism.
    Colonialism or colonial-like activities are that which is important in analyzing the arrival of racialized categories.

    The reason colonialism is so important in the process of racial formation is that it allows for such an extreme form of othering of groups of people that they are conceptualized in society as human but less human than the colonizers, hence a separate race.
    Race becomes something that is inherent to Others and defines essential characteristics about them.
    Once the racial formation process has played out, it becomes self-perpetuating, meaning it will continue even in the absence of an official colonial administration.
    In fact, once created, racial categories become available for self-identification just as any other social category is despite also being imposed by from the outside \parencite[pp.~471-472]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}, hence African-Americans' attempts at co-opting labels that have been attached to them such as through the Black pride movement \parencite{smith_changing_1992}.
    It is not surprising, then, that essentialist beliefs about race have persisted up to the present time in former European colonies despite the end of direct colonialism (\foreign{e.g.}, \citeauthor{hoffman_racial_2016}, \citeyear[p.~4297]{hoffman_racial_2016}; \citeauthor[Roth et al., 2019, as cited in][]{roth_conceptualizations_2023}, \citeyear[p.~45]{roth_conceptualizations_2023}).
    Essentialist views have even been found to persist among researchers in genetics, biology, and anthropology \parencite{roth_conceptualizations_2023}.
    Ideological racism is not necessarily entailed by essentialist views despite the two being associated \parencite[p.~45]{roth_conceptualizations_2023}, but essentialist beliefs are harmful even in the absence of ideological racism.
    % Racial formation
      % Gans (1979) had discussed how 1st and 2nd generation ethnic groups in the US lived in ethnic neighborhoods (i.e., colonies?) where their status as members of the ethnic group were imposed on them from outside (8)
        % This is not entirely different from how race is theorized today, meaning some groups described as ethnic in the past (e.g., Jews, Catholics, Italians, etc. in this case) are better understood as races in modern frameworks

    The definition of racism itself has also changed.
    Up through the 1990s, R. Benedict's (1945) definition of racism as ``the dogma that one ethnic group is condemned by nature to congenital inferiority and another group is destined to congenital superiority'' had been the norm that was used in research \parencite[as cited in][p.~465]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}, though today this would be specifically called ideological racism.
    Importantly, when treating racism as exclusively this sort of irrational ideology, it leaves education as the only solution to alleviated racism, ignoring any rational aspects of the social system that engender this ideology in the first place \parencite[p.~468]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
    The racialized social systems framework thus shifts racism from an irrational personal ideology to a rational structure that creates lower life chances for those placed into a subordinate racialized category \parencite[p.~470]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
    For instance, undocumented Latinx workers in the US generally benefit the economy as a whole \parencite{becerra_fear_2012, edwards_economic_2017}.
    Those who worry about the human rights violations that may occur if mass deportation were carried out have used this benefit as an argument against mass deportation \parencite{shanker_trumps_2024}.
    Likewise, the cost of carrying out mass deportation has been used as an argument in favor of keeping undocumented workers in the US \parencite{american_immigration_council_mass_2024}.
    However, lost in this discussion is that the position of these workers leads to their exploitation where they receive low wages for dangerous work and have little access to healthcare and welfare services \parencite{salinas_systemic_2022}.
    In effect, both those who are against allowing undocumented workers to stay in the US and those who are for keeping them in the country perpetuate a racialized social system that provides these workers with unequal life chances.
    % Racialized social systems
      % Ethnocentrism already existed earlier, and is similar, but doesn't require a sense of superiority (Bonilla-Silva 1997:465)
      % This framework has recently been extended to the level of organizations, which has been argued to not simply be a reflection of an underlying racialized social system (Ray 2019)
        % Ray (2019) stated that neighborhoods can be a sort of meso-level organization to which his framework is applicable (28)
          % This can probably be left out since, even though I'm looking at neighborhoods in a way, what my participants tend to mention is a lot of segregation, which is also what my SNA suggests, whereas to have racialized neighborhoods, groups must be in contact and have different experiences

    \subsection{Colonialism}
      \label{sec:colonialism}
      Colonialism or colonial-like systems are the hallmark of race and, as such, represent that which most distinguishes race from ethnicity.
      To understand if a social category is a racialized category, it is thus important to have an understanding of what colonialism looks like.
      A colony itself has been defined as ``a territory occupied by emigrants from a `mother' country'' who exercise dominance ``over indigenous populations'' in ``economic, ... military, political, and spiritual'' terms \parencite[pp.~28-30]{casanova_internal_1965}.
      These colonized territories are forcibly placed under the management of a dominant society that either transforms or destroys the local culture and racializes the colonized to justify treating them as a subordinate class \parencite[Blauner, 1972, as cited in][p.~246]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      Colonized people are then kept at subsistence levels of living and used as cheap or free labor for a single economic resource without any meaningful ownership of said resource.
      These limitations help ensure a dependence on the colonizers.
      When those who have been colonized challenge this dependency, violence may be used to maintain control \parencite[pp.~30-31]{casanova_internal_1965}, again justified under the belief that the colonized people are a lesser form of human.

      The idea that some version of this traditional, direct, explicit colonialism continues beyond the abolishment of the colonial administration has been present for some time in the US even if not always referred to as internal colonialism.
      Du Bois (1944/1985) argued that such universal traits of colonized and semi-colonized people included facing physical and/or psychological violence, economic exploitation, poverty, lawlessness, crime, illiteracy, disaster, disease, starvation, death, disenfranchisement, and denial of cultural equality \parencite[as cited in][p.~87]{rabaka_web_2007}.
      The lot of African-Americans has therefore been compared to that of colonized people \parencite[Cruse, 1962, as cited in][p.~239]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      The idea was also embraced by the Black Power movement in the late 1960s \parencite[p.~240]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      In terms of activism, colonialism functions both as a comprehensible analogy for expressing the difficulties that a group faces and as a way to develop solidarity with colonized and formerly colonized people in other parts of the world.
      % R. Allen (1969) incorporated social class within the colonized group (as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:249)

      Sociologists have been explicitly developing the concept of internal colonialism since the 1960s.
      It was initially defined as the domination and exploitation of one class of natives by another class of natives in a society after that society had experienced domination and exploitation at the hands of foreigners \parencite[p.~27]{casanova_internal_1965}.
      This dominated class of natives has been conceived of as a nation within a nation \parencite[p.~237]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}, which calls for the careful delineation of said nation when carrying out analyses.
      \textcite{pinderhughes_toward_2011} thus suggested that internally colonized nations be geographically defined (pp.~236/251), raising the possibility of there being many internally colonized nations.

      A more difficult dilemma is deciding whether an internal colony must be related to a former official colony.
      Early formulations held that an internal colony did indeed need to be a former official colony.
      \textcite{casanova_internal_1965}, for instance, stated that internal colonialism involves ``an encounter between two races, cultures, or civilizations, whose genesis and evolution occurred without any mutual contact up to one specific moment,'' which sets it apart from similar situations such as class conflicts or rural-urban conflicts, which may involve groups whose evolution has occurred with consistent contact between them, and is also what ``makes possible intensive racial and cultural discriminations'' (p.~33).
      However, this requirement of separate geneses could hold just as well in any immigration scenario, which is perhaps why a modified form of the original concept has been used by researchers who focus more on immigration, such as \textcite{grosfoguel_race_2004} who proposed the idea of ``colonial immigrant'' groups who find themselves lumped in with existing ``colonial/racial subjects'' by host societies, all of whom are then racialized (p.~323).
      Abandoning the criteria of being a former official colony, though, leaves one in a more precarious position when distinguishing the sort of conflicts that are born out of internal colonialism from any other sort of conflicts.

      Conflict is not solely the purview of race.
      Indeed, \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010} argued that ethnicity had been growing in importance by the 21st century in social and political landscapes in part because of state-internal ethnic conflicts and ethnic migrations leading to conflicts (pp.~2-3).
      Similarly, \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} acknowledged that racial, ethnic, and class conflicts all exist as their own types of conflict (pp.~469/471).
      He provided conflicts in Rwanda and the Balkans as examples of ethnic conflicts, though he did not attempt to formulate a diagnostic for identifying these conflicts as ethnic rather than anything else.
      For class conflicts, \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} did offer more as he argued that class conflicts take precedence over racial conflicts only when ``economic, political, and social distance between races decreases substantially'' (p.~471).
      This argument, while it could also be used for analyzing class versus ethnic conflicts, is only applicable to societies in which racial conflict is already presumed to exist.
      In other words, this approach would not help to identify a conflict as a class conflict in and of itself much less help to distinguish between racial and ethnic conflict.

      The nature of what makes a conflict ethnic has received some attention in sociology, as well.
      \textcite{banton_ethnic_2000} in particular has discussed the difficulties in identifying ethnic conflicts as ethnic.
      He argued that describing a conflict as such implies that the conflict is best understood as being powered by ethnicity over anything else \parencite[p.~483]{banton_ethnic_2000}.
      For instance, the Troubles in Ireland may have appeared to be an ethnic conflict as one involved group was predominantly Catholic and the other predominantly Protestant, but this cannot be classified as an ethnic conflict in Banton's view because it was not that religious difference that caused the conflict in the first place but rather a history of disagreements over the sort of relationship that Ireland should have with England \parencite[p.~485]{banton_ethnic_2000}.
      Indeed, two groups in conflict, even if ethnically distinct, often have relationships along various other dimensions that could have more explanatory power.
      Banton's insistence on ethnicity being the driving force of the conflict before classifying it as ethnic conflict stands in stark contrast to scenarios where people have been racialized.
      Racializing people is seen a justification for colonial activities in modern racial theory and so would never function as the impetus behind a conflict.
      Indeed, even in the case of ethnic conflict, it is difficult to imagine ethnic identity itself as a motivating factor rather than more general intergroup disagreements.
      For instance, in the case of the Rwandan Tutsi genocide that \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} identified as an ethnic conflict, the Tutsi were not killed simply because they were Tutsi but because there longstanding conflicts over access to resources in the country \parencite{magnarella_background_2005}.
      While Banton's approach to identifying conflicts as ethnic rather than non-ethnic would in fact function well as a diagnostic, its theoretical foundations are questionable.
      % When mobilisation efforts aim to reduce these dimensions to ethnicity only, that is one indication that a conflict is ethnic in nature \parencite{banton_ethnic_2000}, though not a sufficient condition in and of itself as that which is used to mobilise a group to action is not necessarily the same as that which motivates the mobilisers.

      Examining the desired outcomes of a conflict could also provide an indication of whether it is ethnic in that a conflict over control of a state cannot be ethnic as this is the feature along which ethnic groups and nations are distinguished.
      A nation is politically oriented \parencite[pp.~6-7]{anderson_imagined_2006}.
      It ``holds that political boundaries should be coterminous with cultural boundaries'' (Gellner, 1983), whereas a nation and an ethnic group are otherwise the same, both delineating groups according to shared culture \parencite[p.~10]{eriksen_ethnicity_2010}.
      This does not exclude ethnic conflicts from having political ends, but those political ends must not be taking over the state.
      Likewise, the sort of conflict inherent to internal colonialism (\foreign{i.e.}, racial conflict) is not restricted from having political components but must also not be specifically about overthrowing a state to install a new racio-state, so to speak.

      While ethnic conflicts have by some been identified by eliminating other motives behind a conflict, racial/colonial conflicts have been theorized more in terms of what they include.
      Racial/colonial conflicts, whether internal or traditional, involve exploitation and domination, making it especially important to establish how these conflicts differ from class conflicts \parencite[p.~108]{wolpe_theory_1975}.
      Indeed, at least in Marxist formulations, class is central to definitions of exploitation.
      Bettelheim (1972), for instance, defined exploitation as the expropriation of the surplus labor of one social class by another social class \parencite[as cited in][p.~110]{wolpe_theory_1975}.
      \textcite{wolpe_theory_1975}, unfortunately, did not offer much in terms of criteria for colonial exploitation specifically, although he did suggest plunder, the exchange of non-equivalents, and price formation practices as possible means of exploitation in colonialism (p.~112).

      The above does not offer much in the way of distinct criteria for distinguishing between class, ethnic, and racial/colonial conflicts, but some provisional conclusions can be operationalized for the purposes of the present study.
      Class conflicts and traditional colonial conflicts are easily distinguished in that, while both involve exploitation, the former is exploitation between social classes and the latter between independent nations, states, or nation-states.
      Internal colonial conflicts, on the other hand, look very much like class conflicts in that both involve expliotation of one group by another within a single society.
      Social class is also likely to be highly correlated with race in the case of internal colonial conflicts as an exploited racialized people will naturally become stuck in a lower social class.
      If internal colonialism is taken to only exist where groups had been involved in traditional colonialism, these similarities can be disentangled easily.
      If not -- if colonial immigrants are to be considered -- the inability of escaping the impact of the conflict for those whose social class is not that which places them in an exploitable position would indicate that the conflict does not have class as a basis.

      Ethnic conflicts, as conceptualized by sociologists such as Banton, are theoretically tenuous.
      The implication is that an ethnic conflict must necessarily be based on cultural ideology and nothing else.
      This, however, leaves unanswered the question of where such an ideology comes from in the first place, which was the theoretical problem that led to the reconceptualization of race and racism.
      The example of Rwanda as an ethnic conflict also resembles a racial/colonial conflict in that it centered on unequal access to resources and thus exploitation and domination.
      Indeed, while this is frequently presented as an ethnic conflict, \textcite{magnarella_background_2005} noted that the Hutu characterized the ``Tutsi as foreign exploiters, belonging to another race'' (p.~821), which would make this more of a racial/colonial conflict than an ethnic conflict.
      Abandoning the idea of ethnic conflict altogether is perhaps the best operationalization as this leaves racial/colonial conflict as any conflict that is based on exploitation and domination, justified by othering of some group of people for whom that othering is inescapable even if the exploitation has been escaped.

    \subsection{Race in the United States}
      \label{sec:united_states}
      While the specific social milieu that will be analyzed here is situated in mostly rural South Louisiana, it would be difficult to interpret the local categories Creole and Cajun without considering their place in the broader racial context of the country as a whole.
      Despite this area being historically considered isolated from the United States, the undoing of that isolation over time has in fact been a factor in not only the decline of F\&C in the state but also the reinterpretation of Creole and Cajun identities, as will be discussed in sections \ref{sec:creole_history} and \ref{sec:cajun_history}.
      For the present section, the discussion will roughly follow Marable's (2002) outlining of the four ``racial domains'' through which African-Americans have passed: slavery, Jim Crow, colonial ghettos, and finally neo-colonial ghettos \parencite[as cited in][]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      This is not say that African-Americans are the only racialized people in the US but they hold a prominent position both in public discourse on race as well as in studies of racialization and so their plight over time is useful for contextualizing how race functions in the US.

      The European colonial enterprise in the Americas began with the exploitation of Others.
      This culminated most prominently with the enslavement of Africans who were then imported into the colonies to perform labor for Europeans colonists.
      The racialization of Africans undoubtedly came about to justify this gross human rights abuse.
      In total, it has been estimated that 9,778,500 enslaved people were imported into the Americas between 1450 and 1867, although it has also been estimated that those exported from Africa between 1450 and 1900 number 11,698,000 \parencite[p.~477]{lovejoy_volume_1982}.
      This implies that upwards of 1,919,500 live were lost just in the process of moving people.
      For the British colonies, these people ended making up a larger proportion of the southern population (39.8\%) than the middle (7.0\%) or the northern (3.1\%) \parencite[Franklin \& Moss, 1988, as cited in][p.~320]{rickford_prior_1997}.
      The territory of modern-day Louisiana, of course was not part of the British colonies but rather New France until the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
      Between 1763 and 1800 Lower Louisiana was consistently divided almost evenly between free people and enslaved people \parencite[p.~279]{hall_africans_1992}.
      This is to say that the colonies in the Americas were ripe for the racialization not only of indigenous people but also of enslaved people.

      After the abolition of slavery, by which time Louisiana was well established as a US state, the Reconstruction era gave rise debates over how to integrate formerly enslaved people into society.
      One such debate was between W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, the former arguing for full inclusion into society and the latter for education to prepare for menial work \parencite[Morris, 2015, as cited in][p.~39]{ray_theory_2019}.
      Most Blacks in the US were not able to move up the social ladder towards full inclusion into society at that time by design, hence it has been argued that there were three social classes related to race: working-class Blacks, a small Black bourgeoisie, and Whites \parencite[R. Allen, 1969, as cited in][p.~249]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      The Black bourgeoisie faced pressure from Whites to keep those in the lower social class under control, which helped them keep their own standing while still ensuring the racial hierarchy.
      This is perhaps a common feature in racialized social systems as a similar middle status group with a similar role, referred to as Morenos or Pardos, also developed in Brazil \parencite[Wade, 1997, as cited in][p.~901]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999} as well as in South Africa, referred to as Coloureds there \parencite[G. Lewis, 1987, as cited in][pp.~338-339]{root_beyond_1992}.
      Creoles in the Americas in general have also been described in similar terms \parencite[pp.~59-60]{anderson_imagined_2006}.
      A theme of oppression is that it often becomes entrenched in a way where it appears to be diminishing but is simply changing in appearance.

      A particularly vivid example of this change of appearance is the Jim Crow era in the US, which presented indications of improvement that either did not last, were not truly significant, or were simply new chains in disguise.
      For instance, the Communist Party USA was calling for the ``self-determination of the Negro nation'' as early as the 1920s, focusing on the Black Belt of the south no less, but had all but withdrawn such support by the time McCarthyism had entered full swing \parencite[p.~242]{pinderhughes_toward_2011}.
      Black banks were also established by the 1920s, but at their peak in 1926, they held only 0.2\% of the total US assets \parencite[Baradaran, 2017, as cited in][p.~38]{ray_theory_2019}, a meager amount which may be related to events such as the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 that led to the destruction of somewhere between \$32,000,000 and \$48,000,000 in property held by Blacks \parencite[p.~1]{albright_after_2021}.
      Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) also started during Jim Crow, but were stunted due to southern legislators having the power to appoint board members, which meant supporters of Jim Crow were placed in these seats \parencite[Williamson, 2004, as cited in][p.~39]{ray_theory_2019}.
      Even the official end of Jim Crow with the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 has been described as the end of the colonial administration in the US but not the end of the colonial situation \parencite[pp.~325-326]{grosfoguel_race_2004}.
      With that act, the racialized social system of the US changed its appearance once more while continuing to create unequal life chances for racialized groups up to the present despite increasing diversity and a reduction in overt acts of intolerance.

      Census records for the United States suggest that diversity has increased, shifting from 1 in 8 people being non-White to 1 in 4.
      When including Latinxs, the ratio becomes 1 in 3 \parencite[pp.~25-26]{fischer_century_2006}.
      This pattern holds through the 2020s with the difference that non-Whites increased to 42\% of the population when including Latinxs.
      Latinxs have indeed become the largest non-White group at 19.5\% of the population, followed by Blacks at 13.7\% \parencite{noauthor_us_2020}.
      At level of the neighborhood, census records suggested that the proportion of White-dominated neighborhoods in the country decreased from 66.0\% to 42.5\% between 1990 and 2010, which may be driven by immigrants mostly settling in highly populous metropolitan areas \parencite[pp.~175-176]{wright_patterns_2014}.
      All of these increases in diversity have also been apparent to White Americans.
      Already by 2000, ``roughly half'' of White Americans thought they were part of a minority group \parencite[Alba et al., 2005, as cited in][p.~437]{smith_social_2014}.
      This increased diversity coupled with Whites' belief that they represent a minority group may have led to a backlash against efforts to solve systemic inequalities.
      As \textcite{omi_racial_1997} observed among White college students in the late 1990s, in apparent resentment, they questioned their own racial identities in response to seeing programs and initiatives in place meant to help non-White groups (p.~20).
      % Ethnic and racial diversity, measured with Shannon entropy using census records, has increased between 1990 and 2010 (0.4576 > 0.6015) (Wright et al. 2014:175)
      % Growth in the Latinx population in 2011 was driven more by births than by immigration (Pew Hispanic Center 2011, as cited in Wright et al. 2014:181)

      Though in general the US has has experienced improved relations in terms of outwardly expressed tolerance of racial minorities between the 1970s and the 2010s \parencite[Bobo et al., 2012; Firebaugh \& Davis, 1988, as cited in][p.~437]{smith_social_2014}, there are still signs of persistent systemic problems.
      Racial income inequality had been decreasing earlier in the 20th century but stalled by 2000 \parencite[Leicht, 2008, as cited in][p.~436]{smith_social_2014}.
      As an example of what this looks like at the local level, \textcite{van_hofwegen_coming_2010} reported that 71\% of African-American youths lived below the poverty line during the years 1990 to 2006 in their longitudinal study in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (p.~431).
      These systemic issues become readily apparent in cases where both Blacks and Whites should face similar hurdles to good life outcomes but do not.
      In New York City, for example, it was found that Blacks with criminal records had more difficulty obtaining employment than Whites who also had criminal records \parencite[Pager, 2007; Pager et al., 2009, as cited in][p.~41]{ray_theory_2019}.
      Pronouncements of racist ideology may not be prevalent in the US anymore, but this has not led to the deracialization of the social system.
      % Increased tolerance has also dovetailed into exploitation for profit through phenomena such as linguistic minstrelsy \parencite{bucholtz_performing_2011, eberhardt_first_2015}.
      % These continued issues tend to focus on African-Americans for obvious reasons: the history of slavery in the US and its reverberations are going to be felt most clearly by the group whose ancestors were the primary group that was enslaved.
      % As will be seen in Section \ref{sec:race_sociolinguistics}, race and ethnicity in sociolinguistics has also been mostly centered on African-Americans when studies are based in the US.
      % White teenagers in general perform AAL \parencite[C. Cutler 2002, as cited in][]{cutler_hip-hop_2007}

      Racist ideologies, in fact, do not need to be pronounced in a society where Whiteness is treated as unmarked as in the US.
      \citeauthor{omi_racial_1997}'s (\citeyear{omi_racial_1997}) observation of White college students indeed exemplifies that Whites in the US have been in a position to not have to concern themselves with their own racial identity.
      Likewise, Statistical Policy Directive 15 in the US, which sets standards for federal racial and ethnic data, linked Blacks to racial groups in Africa whereas no such reference was made linking Whites to European groups nor any other groups \parencite[p.~11]{omi_racial_1997}, implying that once Whiteness is achieved, a group's ancestry no longer matters.
      It is perhaps for this reason that \textcite{waters_ethnic_1990} reported that her White participants saw their ethnicities as ``flexible and symbolic and voluntary'' whereas that was not the case for non-Whites (p.~156).
      This unmarked character of Whiteness also carries over into organizations such as evangelicals (Bracey, 2016) and the National Rifle Association (Zakrison et al., 2017) \parencite[as cited in][p.~46]{ray_theory_2019}.
      In this situation, the markedness applied to non-Whites is itself enough to establish legitimacy for the racist idea that being White is what one should strive for.
      % The Census Bureau concluded that 40% of Hispanics in the US answered incorrectly for their race and ethnicity in 1980 and 1990 because they didn't choose both an ethnicity and a race (Omi 1997:14)

      In sum, the racialization of the United States began before the country was even founded.
      Indigenous and enslaved people were exploited from the moment Europeans landed in the Americas, and that exploitation was justified by racializing them as lesser than (White) Europeans.
      While there have been both changes in laws (\foreign{e.g.}, the abolition of slavery, the undoing of Jim Crow laws) and in the acceptabillity of expressing explicitly racist ideology in public, significant systemic problems have persisted that still result in unequal life outcomes for racialized groups.
      Whiteness remains a privileged status in the US against which other racial identities are measured.

      % In section \ref{sec:race_ethnicity}, it was stated that the assumed definition for race in this study strongly implicates phenotypes, and while I do not wish to immediately backtrack from that definition, it must be acknowledged that racial labeling in the United States is not always so focused on appearance.
      % For example, it has been pointed out that lighter skinned Black people exist who are still considered Black on account of factors such as ancestry and culture \parencite[p.~1]{susberry_racial_2004}.
      % Indeed, bi- and multi-racial individuals may not fit physical prototypical molds for the neat, discrete racial categories into which they are sometimes placed as a result of their racially diverse backgrounds.
      % Americans may not be consciously considering culture when asked racially to categorize individuals, but perhaps this consideration will become more conscious as the US becomes more and more diverse.

    \subsection{Race in sociolinguistics}
      \label{sec:race_sociolinguistics}
      Race has been analyzed in sociolinguistics and language variation studies as far back as the foundational works in the field.
      \textcite{labov_social_2006} considered Italians, Jewish people \parencite{labov_social_2006, labov_contraction_1969, labov_sociolinguistic_1972}, and African-Americans in New York City while \textcite{wolfram_sociolinguistic_1969} looked at African-Americans in Detroit, for instance.
      The field progressed in its treatment of race in much the same way as the field in general did, from the macrosociological level to the ethnographic and local level to social meaning-oriented work \parencite{eckert_three_2012}, but race in language has had its own indiosyncracies in how it has been approached over time.
      Importantly, only more recently have sociological frameworks such as racial formation \parencite{omi_racial_2015} and racialized social systems \parencite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} found their way into sociolinguistics, most notably with the raciolinguistics proposal that aimed to reformulate approaches to racialized language \parencite{rosa_unsettling_2017}.

      Much of the research that came out of the first wave of sociolinguistics was aimed at showing that the languages used by racialized groups were indeed logical and rule-bound.
      This does not mean that they did not touch on connections to social issues, but social issues were not yet the focus of this work.
      For instance, \textcite{labov_social_2006} analyzed Italians, Jewish people, and African-Americans in New York City and found that they all had their own vowel usage patterns in English.
      Notably, for some of the ongoing vowel changes in New York City, African-American usage ``follow[ed] an entirely different pattern'' \parencite[p.~247]{labov_social_2006}, which could most likely be interpreted as an expression of the segregation between Black and White Americans.
      Although this was not a point Labov seemed to be attempting to make, it was nonetheless an important social finding present in that early work.
      It is also notable that race and ethnicity were treated as synonyms during the first wave of sociolinguistics.
      Indeed, \textcite{labov_social_2006} said of the groups mentioned above that they constituted ``the three \emph{ethnic groups} large enough to be studied in the sample'' [italics mine] (p.~180), though one could argue that all three were racialized at one time or another in the US \parencite{roediger_working_2018}.

      While first wave studies of language variation went a long way towards reducing the stigma attached to minority varieties, some of the framing was still problematic.
      One of those framings was the regular use of the qualifier \lexi{non-standard} for varieties spoken mostly by minority groups \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][p.~715]{labov_contraction_1969}, but perhaps the most significant framing issue was the idea that African-American Language (AAL) was a single monolithic variety, which may have simply been the good intention of wanting to demonstrate the logical structure of AAL being taken too far.
      Fieldwork on AAL from locations as varied as Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Los Angeles were all described as essentially the same language variety with only a few minor variations \parencite[p.~715]{labov_contraction_1969}.
      Even by the 1990s, well into the second wave of sociolinguistics, African-American speech was still being described, for example, as ``the uniform grammar used by African Americans who have minimal contact with other dialects typically in contexts where only speakers of that vernacular are present'' \parencite[Labov, 1998, as cited in][p.~165]{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010} or as a continuum, called African-American English in this case, ranging from essentially the privileged varieties in American English to African-American Vernacular English \parencite[Rickford, 1999, as cited in][p.~165]{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010}.
      Such aggregating of the speech of disparate groups of people risked being a source of erasure not only of distinct ways of speaking but of the distinct identities that are attached to those ways of speaking.

      The second wave of sociolinguistics was said to have begun with \textcite{milroy_language_1987} \parencite[p.~91]{eckert_three_2012}.
      The attention that AAL received during the first wave diminished during this time, and what work was being done in that area involved more fine-grained analyses.
      For example, \textcite{rickford_addressee-_1994} examined constraints on style shifting relative to the race of an African-American woman's interlocutors.
      In zooming in to more local contexts, more local social categories also became the focus.
      In one case tangentially related to the current study, the verbal morphology of ``Cajun Vernacular English'' was analyzed not only on its own but in relation to White southern varities as well as AAL, suggesting a complex relationship between Cajuns and these other groups.
      However, while local categories such as Cajun were being considered, they were not receiving the sort of close critical treatment that they merited.
      Cajun identity itself was thus not defined at all in \textcite{dubois_verbal_2003} but instead implied to simply be the identity of Whites in South Louisiana.

      The usefulness of social categories such as ethnicity was examined during the second wave, as well.
      \textcite{horvath_delimiting_1987}, although not working on language in the US, explicitly discussed the utility of ethnicity as a social variable.
      They argued that ethnicity is not well defined because it might have varying degrees of influence depending on which immigration generation one is in as well as between those in the same immigration generation but from different communities \parencite[p.~183]{horvath_delimiting_1987}.
      In the latter point, they were avoiding the trappings that earlier researchers fell into when establishing AAL as a monolith.
      They were also making immigration the central factor in ethnic group formation, similar to what \textcite{labov_social_2006} had implicitly done by singling out Italians in New York City.
      This aligned with the emphasis that A. D. Smith (1986) was placing on immigration for the formation of ethnic identities at that time \parencite[as cited in][p.~903]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999}.
      Indeed, both \textcite{weber_economy_1978} and \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010}, discussed in Section \ref{sec:race_ethnicity}, also highlighted contact as a necessary condition for ethnic identities to form, as does the concept of enregisterment from the third wave of sociolinguistics for named language varieties \parencite{agha_social_2003, johnstone_mobility_2006}.
      The point being that, by the end of the second wave, researchers had begun to be more cognizant of the need to reconsider how social variables are used and understood, and that included ethnicity even if race was not being prominently addressed.
      % By the end of the second wave, Rickford in particular was trying to encourage socioliguists to use their positions and knowledge (that they've by and large gained via the good will of minority groups) to give back to minority communities (e.g., Rickford 1997 "Unequal")

      The third wave of sociolinguistics turned the focus of research towards social meaning and local categories even more so, making it perhaps not surprising that race has been examined more carefully during this phase.
      This includes attempts to correct early framings of AAL that treated it as a monolith.
      Indeed, the data needed to conclude that AAL is not a monolith had been present and available for some time already but was not interpreted as suggesting that there was variation between groups of AAL speakers.
      As \textcite{jones_toward_2015} pointed out, for example, \textcite{labov_language_1972} found non-rhoticity among some speakers in New York City but \textcite{riney_linguistic_1990} found full rhoticity Waterloo, Iowa (p.~404).
      Likewise, \textcite{rickford_addressee-_1994} reported that Foxy Brown, an individual African-American woman from the California Bay Area, exceeded the cumulative total use of invariant habitual \lexi{be} by all of the speakers analyzed in New York City \parencite{labov_study_1968}, Detroit \parencite{wolfram_sociolinguistic_1969}, and Brazos Valley, Texas \parencite{bailey_decreolization_1987} (p.~254), although no acknowledgement was made that this may be an indication of these simply being different varieties of AAL.
      By the 2010s, in contrast, findings on AAL were being argued as suggesting that there is regional variation despite the existence of ``supra-regional'' features that are shared in all regions that are not part of European American speech \parencite[p.~232]{wolfram_american_2016}, and work had begun on mapping out these regional variations \parencite{jones_toward_2015}.

      More relevant to the current study is that third wave studies have still rarely dealt with racialization but rather used race and ethnicity as synonyms.
      For instance, \citeauthor{wolfram_american_2016}'s (\citeyear{wolfram_american_2016}) review started out by stating, ``African American English (AAE) is the paradigmatic case of ethnicity-based language diversity'' (p.~217), although African-Americans themselves had been at the center of sociological work on racialization since \textcite{omi_racial_2015}.
      Likewise, \textcite{becker_linguistic_2014} framed her study of AAL as a study of an ethnolect rather than a raciolect or racialized variety in stating, ``African American English (AAE) is the quintessential ethnolect in North American sociolinguistics'' (p.~44).
      This framing pattern can be seen widely in sociolinguistic literature.
      \textcite{reyes_appropriation_2005} mostly discussed both Asian and African American identities as racial while also occasionally framing these as part of ethnic studies, and \textcite{rahman_middle-class_2008} explicitly equated race and ethnicity while framing African-American identity as an ethnic identity.
      In the case of \textcite{wolfram_american_2016}, statements such as ``contact between whites and blacks over the generations may have resulted in speakers of both ethnicities picking up features of one another'' (p.~225) make it clear that they were treating race and ethnicity as one and the same.
      This approach, where race and ethnicity are synonyms, and relatedly Black and African-American are often synonyms, makes it all but impossible to analyze the racialization of certain peoples as well as the racialization of their ways of speaking.
      % Save for few exceptions, such as \textcite{bucholtz_white_2010} who argued that ``race is ideologically grounded ... in biological differences'' and ethnicity in ``cultural differences'' (pp.~5-6), the distinction between race and ethnicity is little mentioned in sociolinguistics, which is relevant to this study in that it aims to fill that gap by offering a more intersectional analysis of these two social categories.
      % At times in Mendoza (2008), ethnicity appears as basically a synonym for race or national heritage
        % Speaking of a discussion with a participant, Mendoza-Denton (2008) explains "that she does not think of herself as ethnically or racially white" (124)
        % Explaining a participant who said that the parents of Norteñxs "are, one American, and one Mexican, much of the time," Mendoza-Denton (2008) says that Norteñxs are understood "as being ethnically mixed" (123)

      \citeauthor{wolfram_american_2016}'s (\citeyear{wolfram_american_2016}) statement also raises the question of crossing racial and ethnic boundaries, which has also been a focal point for third wave sociolinguistics that is relevant to behavior that will be seen among participants of the current study.
      This phenomenon had more or less been coined near the end of the second wave of sociolinguistics as \lexi{crossing}, a general term that refers to when a speaker switches to any language code that is not considered to belong to them regardless of what class of people own said language code, so to speak \parencite{rampton_crossing:_1995}.
      However, crossing refers to a sort of momentary code-switching rather than one's primary language being that which does not typically align with their social identity, both of which have been dealt with in the literature, often, though not always, in terms of the use of AAL.

      Given the glottonym African-American Language, the presumed owning group for this variety is African-Americans, though as C. Cutler (2002) put it, White people ``can and do pass for native speakers of AAE'' \parencite[as cited in][p.~529]{cutler_hip-hop_2007}.
      How such boundary crossing is characterized can depend on the direction in which it is occurring.
      It has been argued that in studies of African-Americans using linguistic features that index White identities, researchers conceptualize this as assimilation, but in studies of White people using African-American features \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][]{bucholtz_you_1999}, researchers conceptualize this as indexing African-American qualities that these speakers admire \parencite[p.~27]{eckert_where_2008}.
      Such framing helps to reify the position of Whites at the top of the racial hierarchy.
      As \textcite{bucholtz_white_2010} poignantly -- and perhaps ironically -- stated in her analysis of White youths constructing their identities through the use of AAL features, ``The hegemony of whiteness is typically exerted not by calling attention to white racial dominance but instead by treating whiteness as unremarkable -- even unnoticeable'' (p.~15).

      Not all boundary crossing studies have looked at White people using AAL features nor even implicated AAL at all.
      In Philadelphia, Asian American youths were seen using AAL features to varying degrees to thread the delicate needle of finding their place in the racial system of the United States \parencite{reyes_appropriation_2005}.
      In the South Carolina Sea Island, a pair of speakers, one White and one Black, were both documented using English-based creole phonological features, but only the Black speaker used creole morphosyntactic features \parencite[Rickford, 1985, as cited in][pp.~390-391]{fought_ethnicity_2013}.
      In California, both White and Latinx students were reported exploiting a phonological variable, but within the Latinx group, this variable also indexed their place in the social order of the school \parencite{eckert_where_2008}.
      These sort of cases of drawing from language varieties associated with other groups in different ways and to different degrees led \textcite{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010} to codify this in her ethnolinguistic repertoire framework.
      She described an ethnolinguistic repertoire as ``a fluid set of linguistic resources that members of an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities'' (p.~160).
      While it might seem as though this framework is meant only for dealing with ethnicity, Benor made clear that the it could be used for non-ethnic identities, as well.

      What this discussion of crossing racial and ethnic boundaries often exemplifies is approaches to constructing racial and ethnic identities, but constructing racial and ethnic identities through language is also influenced by other social factors.
      National identity was seen as an important factor in the identity construction of Latinas in California \parencite{mendoza-denton_homegirls:_2008}, while socioeconomic class was seen to create problems for African-American identity construction in terms of having to navigate maintaining one's identitly while facing pressure to change for greater economic opportunities \parencite{rahman_middle-class_2008}.
      Even being bilingual can be a source of tension relevant to racial and ethnic identity construction.
      \textcite{rosa_looking_2019} argued that language and race ideologies delegitimize the use of both languages that bilinguals possess in that they are treated as imperfect speakers of both not because their speech is not structured similar to monolinguals of both languages but because perceptions of their speech are tainted by racial ideologies and concepts of authenticity (pp.~125-127).
      Racialized people thus face great societal pressure that constrains their ability to construct their identities through linguistic means as they see fit.
      % In New York, Asian and non-Asian speakers differed in their realizations of /ɛ/ and breathiness with Asian men producing more fronted variants and breathier speech (Newman & Wu 2011:166/168)
      % A Lumbee Indian being interviewed by a African-American Cherokee showed how ethnic identity can be linguistically negotiated in real time as the speakers' speech was most different when discussing race and most similar while discussing friends and family (Schilling-Estes 2004)

      \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017} brought work on race in sociology, where race is initially imposed on a people through colonial processes, into sociolinguistics to improve analyses of racialized language.
      Their raciolinguistic perspective was indeed centered on the idea that the naturalization (\foreign{i.e.}, the act of making something seem natural) of races and languages with those races was a ``central component[] of the European colonial formation of modernity'' (p.~623).
      In other words, language was used as another way to mark racialized people and maintain dominance over them.
      As an example, AAL speakers have been shown to be routinely identified as Black and consequently more frequently denied housing opportunities when calling rental and sales offices \parencite{lanehart_swb_2015}.
      While the subordination of racialized people has not been ignored in the literature before \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, it has been brought more to the forefront as have the sociological tools for analyzing it.
      % Linguicism or "'linguistically argued racism'" exists (Skutnabb-Kangas 1988; Phillipson 1992, as cited in Rosa 2019:139), which is used because biologically argued racism is no longer accepted in public discourse but linguistically argued racism is (Uricuoli 1996, 2001; Zentella 2007, as cited in Rosa 2019:139)
      % Rosa & Flores (2017) stuff
        % Hierarchically then, non-European languages were also placed below European languages (Makoni & Pennycook 2007; Veronelli 2015, as cited in Rosa & Flores 2017:623)
        % They called this linking of language and racial identity raciolinguistic enregisterment (Rosa & Flores 2017:631) after Agha's enregisterment (2003)
        % Racialized Others are unable to overcome this naturalization even when they learn the language of their oppressors which is still perceived as linguistically lacking (Rosa & Flores 2017:625, citing others)
          % This has important implications as language skills can be seen as a commodity (Rosa & Flores 2017:638, citing Heller & Duchêne 2012 as giving examples)
        % Bonfiglio (2002, 2010) argued that categories such as "Standard American English" and "native speaker" should be understood as representing racialized perceptions where anything associated with the dominant group is unmarked and anything associated with the dominated racialized group is inherently deficient (as cited in Rosa & Flores 2017:632)
      % Rosa & Flores (2017) proposed that perceptual work on race should refuse to analyze the production of racialized people and instead look at how listeners employ their race and language ideologies in interpreting racialized people (628-629)
        % This approach has not really been taken up for the obvious reason that knowing what racialized people are objectively producing is a necessary step in interpreting how a listeners ideologies are shaping what they are hearing
      % A natural response to the issues this framework raises is to propose affirming the language of racialized populations and providing them access to the tools needed to learn dominant ways of speaking, but this solution ignores the problems inherent in the racialized social system itself and puts the burden on racialized people to do more than others need to do (Rosa & Flores 2017:639)

      Race has, in sum, always held a prominent place in sociolinguistics despite having been dealt with differently over time.
      Early work did much to establish AAL and other language varieties associated with racialized groups as rule-bound and logical.
      Second and early third wave studies began looking more closely at local categories while giving more fine-grained analyses of broader social categories.
      It was also at that time that the validity of social categories was questioned.
      It has not been until relatively recently, however, that sociological work on race has found its way into sociolinguistics, although there is still much to add to the literature in terms of incorporating the theories of racial formation and racialized social systems into sociolinguistic analyses.

    % This influx had the potential to erase the local culture of the region, and indeed, \textcite{johnson_louisiana_1976} claimed that White francophone Louisianians also attempted to unify around culture and language to enact laws that would prevent the newcomers from participating in local politics (p.~20), making it clear that even when feeling threatened from the outside, the racial order in Louisiana still held such importance for those in power that they were not willing to allow those of lower social status to join them in their efforts to restrain said outside threat.

    % It is fitting then, to take a moment to discuss Creole and Cajun identities.

  \section{The history of Creole people}
    \label{sec:creole_history}
    When focusing in on race and ethnicity in Louisiana, two social categories that are often evoked are Creole and Cajun, hence these are the categories being examined here to help shed light on racialization in the state.
    The former category and the related group have a rather complex and winding history.
    At the outset of the colonization of Louisiana, a Creole was simply someone born in the colony regardless.\footnote{
      It is notable that American Indians who resided in the territory have not figured into discussions in the literature about who was and who was not considered a Creole in the early colonial history of Louisiana, although they were quite obviously being born in the territory.
    }
    This was not a particularly distinguishing status until the Louisiana Purchase, at which time the arrival of Americans made being a Creole something more notable than it had been previously.
    After the Civil War and through much of the Jim Crow years, there were efforts to redefine the term as applying to only Whites of French or Spanish descent, but this effort was not entirely successful as perhaps the most common understanding of Creole for Louisianians today is as something of a synonym for Black.
    These developments will be discussed in more detail in this section to elucidate what the path to racialization of a people looks like or otherwise how it is avoided.
    
    % In mid- to late-19th century New Orleans, for example, the term could be used in such a generalized way that it was applied to food as a synonym for local \parencite[p.~21]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
    % For people, however, the term has been applied to variously to groups such as those of French and/or Spanish descent born in Louisiana and those of mixed African and European descent \parencite{dominguez_social_1977}.
    % It is also common to encounter Louisianians today who equate \lexi{Creole} with \lexi{Black}.
    % My own participants were all asked to define what a Creole is, and the topic consistently evoked strong reactions that suggested that the answer for them is long and complicated, especially when the question was put to my Cajun participants.
    % When discussing Creoles in terms of non-Whites, \textcite{susberry_racial_2004} suggested that interest has been maintained due to concern over Louisiana exports being marketed as ``Cajun'' and thereby erasing Creole contributions, the lack of laws or even census options that lead to pigeonholing Creoles as Black, an indirectly related focus on French language education in Louisiana, and the popularity of geneological research in the state (p.~14), although on this last point, I would argue that geneological research is popular because Creole and especially Cajun identities are tightly linked to one's ancestry in the minds of residents, as will become apparent in the ensuing discussions.

    Much of the research on the various stages in the development of the definition of Creoles has focused on New Orleans rather than the state as a whole.
    This caveat to the ensuing discussion could be explained due to the city simply being a more attractive object of study for historians or perhaps to a lack of primary data for the areas outside of New Orleans.
    However, especially for the 18th century, this is a sensible focus as New Orleans was the colonial population center of the territory.
    Censuses of rural plantations and other settlements in South Louisiana in the 1700s were not numerous but did exist (\citeauthor{mills_family_1981}, \citeyear[p.~27]{mills_family_1981}; \citeauthor{zitomersky_urbanization_1974}, \citeyear[pp.~276-277]{zitomersky_urbanization_1974}).
    These numbers indicate that, for example, there were 4,983 colonists and enslaved people living in the territory of modern day Louisiana, not including American Indians nor women, of which 1,183 or about 24\% were outside of New Orleans, mostly in Pointe Coupee \parencite[p.~177]{hall_africans_1992}.
    In contrast, there were 1,005,281 people estimated to reside in the entire New Orleans metropolitan area in 2020 \parencite{us_census_bureau_metropolitan_2020} compared to the 4,657,757 living in the entire state \parencite{us_census_bureau_us_2020}, meaning that roughly 78\% of the population was living outside of New Orleans.
    The region of focus for this study is around the Lafayette area, a good distance from New Orleans, so research specifically on that area rather than on New Orleans would be ideal, but given the disparity in population, it is still reasonable to assume that early views on Creoles were not significantly different in the rural areas of Louisiana from in New Orleans.
    As the rural population increased later in the 19th century and beyond, more research also becomes available from rural perspectives.
    % Up to the Louisiana Purchase
      % Natchitoches was the first permanent colonial settlement in 1714 (E. S. Mills 1981:3)
        % Census figures suggest that the population grew from 62 in 1722 to 1,778 in 1802 (E. S. Mills 1981:27)
          % During these years, the percentage of non-White residents wavered around 50%, although Creole didn't mean non-White at that time
        % These numbers look quite different from what G. M. Hall (1992) reported for 1746, though

    The term \lexi{Creole} was originally just a synonym for local or native to the colonies of the American continents, a usage that dates back at least as far back as 1731 according to baptismal records from New Orleans \parencite[pp.~95-97]{dominguez_white_1986}.
    This means not only were French and Spanish colonists considered to be Creoles but so were many enslaved Africans.
    Likewise, free people of color, often referred to by with the French term \foreign{gens de couleur libres}, were uncontroversially described as Creoles when they were born in Louisiana.

    Free people of color were not unique to Louisiana, but they were particularly common there.
    They were also regularly implicated in redefinitions of the term \lexi{Creole}, especially during Reconstruction.
    A court case involving one François Tioucou suggests that Free People of Color were present in New Orleans since at least the early 18th century.
    Tioucou was not, however, a Creole as he was born in Africa \parencite[pp.~32-33]{everett_free_1966}, meaning that free person of color did not necessarily imply Creole at that time.
    A common path to freedom for those born in Louisiana was through a system known as plaçage in which free men entered into relationships with enslaved women or free women of color that in many ways resembled marriages.
    According to the French Black Code or \foreign{Code noire} that was in effect at that time, free men were not permitted to marry nor ``vivre en concubinage''\footnote{
      Cohabit.
    } \parencite[pp.~3-4]{louis_xv_code_1727}.
    Despite this, the lopsided male and female populations in the region provided White men with an incentive to have these liaisons anyway.
    According to census records, in 1721 there were 293 men but only 140 women in rural Louisiana \parencite[Beer, 1911, as cited in][pp.~15-16]{klingler_if_2003}.
    Relatedly, funeral records from the late 18th century suggest a median age of 30.6 for White men and 30.3 for free women of color but only 18.1 for White women and 8.1 for free men of color \parencite[p.~220]{hanger_coping_1997}.
    The simplest path towards creating a family was thus with enslaved women or free women of color.
    For the women, particularly enslaved women, these relationships offered them benefits up to the possibility of freedom for them and their offspring, hence becoming free people of color.
    The practice thus continued through the 18th century as well as the 19th century.
    Indeed, firsthand reports indicated that balls for arranging these relationships were being held in first half of the 19th century (\citeauthor{featherstonhaugh_excursion_1968}, \citeyear[pp.~141-142]{featherstonhaugh_excursion_1968}; \citeauthor{latrobe_southern_1986}, \citeyear[p.~77]{latrobe_southern_1986}).
    % Only 6 "mulattoes" were in the 1732 census for New Orleans (Everett 1966:32-33)
    % The Black Code gave children the status of their mothers (Louis XV 1727:4)
    % Canon (1995) argued that the choices of oppressed groups are necessarily constrained by their circumstances (as cited in J. Martin 2000:64)

    % Anderson (1983/2006) also understood Creole and Criollo in the New World to mean a "person of (at least theoretically) pure European descent but born in the Americas" (47)
      % Anderson (1983/2006) argued that Creoles were excluded from being Europeans despite being generally indistinguishable physically and cultural, so they felt compelled to hold themselves above locals and mixed people in the New World, which for him "foreshadows modern racism" (59-60)

    Plaçage arrangements could take on various forms.
    In some cases, these were lifelong commitments, whereas in others they might have lasted a few years, often ending when the man entered into a legal marriage with a White woman.
    \textcite{martineau_society_1966-1}, getting her information from ``ladies who cannot be mistaken,'' suggested that for the enslaved women and free women of color afterward, the dissolution of the relationship meant the end of any possibility for another relationship for the rest of their lives.
    Some committed suicide while ``more die[d] broken-hearted'' (pp.~326-327).
    The latter result was perhaps poetic musing on the part of Martineau despite the methodological rigor of this early sociological work, as all accounts suggest that plaçage was a practical matter for these women rather than a matter of love.
    For this reason, \textcite{kein_placage_2000} characterized women's choice to enter into plaçage as a matter of doing whatever they could to survive given their limited life options (p.~65).
    Enslaved women and free women of color wanted to attain a higher social status and, in the case of the former, rights by having children to White men and even gaining inheritances in the process.
    % Martineau (1837/1966) reported discussions of Quadroon women (free or enslaved) that she had with "ladies who cannot be mistaken" (326-327)
      % They are "highly educated, externally, and are, probably, as beautiful and accomplished a set of women as can be found" (326)

    Children who came out of the plaçage system were of course considered Creoles just as any Whites, enslaved people, or free people of color who were born in the colony.
    This use of the term \lexi{Creole} as locally born was still commonly seen in newspapers in the 1820s and 1830s where it was even applied to Anglo-Americans and Acadians\footnote{
      Acadians, whose name evolved into Cajun, will be discussed in their own right in section \ref{sec:cajun_history}.
    } exiled from modern-day Canada who had been born in Louisiana.
    In the case of the latter, it was particularly well established that the press viewed Alexandre Mouton, an Acadian and eleventh governor of Louisiana from 1843 to 1846, as a Creole \parencite[pp.~23-24]{tregle_early_1952}.
    Despite this ongoing use of \lexi{Creole} to mean local or native, it has also been argued that the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 entailed the beginning of a shift towards the fact of being a Creole being a distinguishing feature of one's identity \parencite[pp.~134-135]{hirsch_creoles_1992}.

    The impact that the arrival of Americans had on the identity and status of Creoles was perhaps initially felt most directly by free people of color.
    At the outset of the 19th century, free people of color were certainly not the social and legal equals of Whites, but they did enjoy significantly more rights than enslaved people.
    Free people of color were able to obtain an education, use the courts, work, and own property \parencite[p.~34]{tregle_early_1952}.
    Notorial acts in New Orleans show that they were at least trading in real estate, boats, lumber, and jewelry \parencite[p.~242]{hanger_avenues_1990}.
    Such trading resulted in free people of color in New orleans owning an estimated \$2 million in assets in 1836 which increased to between \$13 million and \$15 million by 1860, all of which included owning enslaved people \parencite[p.~15]{stone_negro_1900}.
    Indeed, in opposition to proposed legislation that would strip the right of free people of color to own property, a newspaper editorial from 1852 argued that free people of color were more disdainful of enslaved people than even Whites were, meaning that Whites had no need to fear free people of color upsetting the social order.
    The proposal was ultimately not passed nor did another proposal in 1846 to remove the right of free people of color to bear witness in court.
    In this case, one can easily see the fragile intermediate social status of free people of color in the argument that the chair of the judiciary committee made against the measure in the legislature.
    The chair argued that rescinding this right was inconvenient for the courts, adding that laws should aim to ``elevate, not degrade'' the ``better class'' of free people of color \parencite[pp.~172-175]{sterkx_free_1972}.
    In this one argument, it was signaled that free people of color were intimately linked to a lower class of people even while suggesting that they should be raised up and supported.

    Though the effort to remove the rights of free people of color to own property and to bear witness in court failed, this move highlights the continual deterioration of the rights of free people of color throughout the 1800s as Whites became more and more unsettled by their status, wanting instead to collapse them in with enslaved people.
    These moves started shortly after the Louisiana Purchase when a new Black Code was enacted in 1807 along with additional related acts.
    Included in this new legislation were provisions that required enslaved people to be at least 30 years old and in good standing for at least the last four years in order to be eligibly for manumission, the intended effect being to make it more difficult to be freed \parencite[p.~83]{territory_of_orleans_acts_1807-1}.
    The Civil Code of 1808 also reaffirmed that marriage between a free and enslaved person would be illegal as well as between a White person and a free person of color \parencite[p.~25]{dominguez_white_1986}.
    
    While these laws greatly limited avenues towards greater rights for enslaved people and in part for free people of color, as well, actions were also taken to official limit the economic prospects of free people of color.
    \court{Boisdoré and Goulé v.~Bank} was a case in 1833 involving Citizens Bank of New Orleans who asserted that they had a right to refuse to sell stocks to free people of color.
    Their argument ultimately convinced the court, paving the way for a reduction in the ability to own assets or even participate in business ventures \parencite[p.~52]{kein_marcus_2000}.
    Perhaps even more deleterious, however, was the result of \court{Jung v.~Doriscourts et al.}~the year before, which established that the French inheritance laws that had been in effect up to that point, which allowed children born via plaçage arrangements to inherit the father's wealth, were no longer valid \parencite[p.~231]{johnston_race_1970}.
    All these of these actions had the effect of undermining the purpose of the plaçage system for enslaved people and free people of color while also making it more difficult to be freed in the first place and more difficult to get ahead once freed, bringing free people of color closer in line with the lot of enslaved people.

    Attempts to collapse free people of color and enslaved people into one category intensified further after the Civil War.
    Louisiana was in a state of financial ruin \parencite[pp.~428-429]{winters_civil_1963}, and that combined with the loss of the war and finding even more Blacks walking freely left Whites feeling that that place in the social order was insecure.
    Indeed, animosity towards Blacks commonly found expression in newspapers.
    In some cases, these articles even found Whites explicitly linking their feelings of animosity to the results of the war \parencite[pp.~173-175]{blassingame_black_1973}.
    Public calls were soon being made for all Louisianians, all Creoles, to declare themselves either Black or White and nothing in between.
    For their part, former free people of color, not immune to the change in fortunes in the state, were split on whether to align themselves with formerly enslaved people or with Whites \parencite[p.~135-137]{dominguez_white_1986}.
    For Whites, the choice of how to racially identify former free people of color was not a difficult one.

    While the term \lexi{Creole} was applied to Whites, free people of color, and enslaved people through much of the 19th century, it was after the war that the ``Creole myth'' came about, asserting that only those of pure White blood were Creoles \parencite{hirsch_creoles_1992}.
    In the most innocuous of perpetuations of this myth, one finds clarifying appositions in letters such as one from 1878 that equate Creoles with those ``of French descent'' in contrast to Americans who were those ``of English descent'' \parencite[p.~245]{mccants_they_1970}.
    Something of the old definition still resides in this contrast as Americans, especially when referred to in F\&C (\foreign{i.e.}, \foreign{les Américains}), is said even today to refer to those who are not from South Louisiana, but the emphasis on French descent suggests a White European identity for Creoles as the other end of that contrast.
    In other perpetuations of the myth, there was the addition of the romanticized idea of Creoles having been a sort of aristocratic class.
    \textcite{fortier_french_1884} described Creoles as specifically Whites born in the Americans with either French or Spanish heritage, arguing that they ``occupied a high standing'' before the war (p.~98).
    His evidence was a list of successful politicians going back to the second governor of the US state, a list that was in fact in direct contradiction to the original use of the term \lexi{Creole} as it included people like the fifth governor of Louisiana, Pierre Derbigny, who was born in France.
    Finally, some perpetuations of the myth were rather dehumanizing.
    For example, \textcite{tinker_toucoutou_1928}, writing well after Reconstruction, did not disregard that non-Whites were described as Creoles but rather claimed that this was always with a lowercase \orth{c} indicating an adjective as could be applied to any type of Louisiana product: carrots, eggs, or in this case people (pp.~7-8).
    Of course, Tinker did not provide any evidence for this claim, and it flies in the face of much of the evidence already discussed here.

    The Creole myth was likely more successful at redefining who Creoles were during the colonial and antebellum periods than in redefining Creoles contemporaneously.
    There were and still are people who openly identify as Creoles of color, although they have been effectively aggregated into the Black side of a Black-White racial dichotomy that has been pursued since Reconstruction.
    By the turn of the century, those who were not White or could not pass for White were subject to Jim Crow laws such as the poll tax that was implemented by the Louisiana constitution of 1898 \parencite[pp.~80-81]{louisiana_constitution_1898}.
    This created the impetus for some Creoles of color to attempt to pass as White.
    The practice of passing has been documented in New Orleans where families would pass for the sake of the success of their businesses in the 1940s.
    Some in the 1970s and 1980s continued the practice, as well, sometimes passing in all social contexts, sometimes in limited contexts, sometimes asserting their Whiteness so forcefully that they deny their heritage and sometimes not \parencite[pp.~200-203]{dominguez_white_1986}.
    Situations such as this are why \textcite{kein_placage_2000} argued that the tenuous existence of Creoles of color has created a schism between them and non-Creole Blacks that endured up until her time at least (pp.~69-70).
    Indeed, the drastic changes in the social and political landscape since the first Creoles came about have resulted in the category and by extension the people difficult to pin down.

    More recently, researchers have attempted to pin down the definition of Creole by asserting that they are multiracial people.
    \textcite{susberry_racial_2004} defined them as ``[m]ultiracial people whose ancestral history is connected to Louisiana'' (p.~8), while \textcite{giancarlo_dont_2019} stated that they are mixed race people with French cultural origins (p.~42), although it is not entirely clear what it means to have French cultural origins.
    These definitions harken back in particular to free people of color who, when born of the plaçage system, were given racial designations based on the presumed mixture of Black and White races in their ancestry \parencite[p.~35]{tregle_early_1952}.
    Centering the definition on multiracial people does not entirely contradict the original sense of local or native but does prevent those who do not claim a mixed ancestry from identifying as Creole.
    That said, some of my own participants used the idea of racial mixture as an aspect of being Creole.
    % Definitions (researchers)
      % In general, Susberry (2004) found that ethnic identity achievement, self-esteem, self-perceived skin color, and "Creole dialect" fluency had statistically significant impacts on racial identifications, but negative treatment by Whites, negative treatment by Blacks, and the perceived social status of Blacks were not statistically significant (47)
        % Creoles of Color who identified as Black believed they appeared Black to others whereas those who identified as Creole believed they appeared ambiguous to others, suggesting a link between beliefs about their own appearances to others and how they choose to self-identify (Susberry 2004:45/48)
          % An implication is that one needs to be able to at least believe that society doesn't see them as Black in order for them to self-identify as Creole, though it's not clear if this held true for my own participants.

    Louisianians themselves have indeed been documented as highlighting a mixed racial ancestry as a criteria for being Creole, although not always.
    The Creoles of color with whom \parencite{susberry_racial_2004} worked described Creoles as mixed race while also suggesting that they have a French or Spanish history that is linked specifically to South Louisiana (p.~56), the latter feature being one invented for the White Creole myth that has evidently spilled into modern non-White definitions of \lexi{Creole}.
    This linkage to French or Spanish ancestry resulted in some participants being unaware of their eligibility to claim a Creole identity until later in life (p.~59).
    Other Creoles of color in \citeauthor{susberry_racial_2004}'s (\citeyear{susberry_racial_2004}) study took the term to be more of a cultural concept.
    The implicated cultural features implicated are by and large shared with Cajuns, though neither Cajuns not Creoles themselves accepted participation in such culture as a sufficient criteria for being Cajun if one was also considered Black (\citeauthor{esman_henderson_1985}, \citeyear[p.~7]{esman_henderson_1985}; \citeauthor{spitzer_cajuns_1977}, \citeyear{spitzer_cajuns_1977}).
    In other words, Cajun has become a specifically White identity and Creole a non-White identity.
    It has thus been argued by some that the most common definition for Creoles in recent times is someone with African ancestry and roots in Louisiana \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][pp.~39-40]{eble_creole_2008}, which is a common finding when study participants in Louisiana are interrogated about their identities.
    \textcite{klingler_language_2003}, for instance, found that all 19 of his participants in St Landry Parish who identified as Creole also identified as Black (p.~82).

    Those who in the past might have identified as White Creoles, in contrast, have become much more likely to identify as Cajun.
    Where \lexi{Cajun} had been a derogatory term even up to the mid 1970s, it was transformed into a positive, catch-all term for White South Louisianians by the early 1980s largely through the efforts of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) \parencite[pp.~164-167]{trepanier_cajunization_1991}.
    However, as \textcite{eble_creole_2008} observed, there are Louisianians ``from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds'' who have been attempting to revive the old meaning of Creole as simply meaning native (p.~49).
    Indeed, cultural activists in the state such as Gene Buller and John LaFleur II have rejected the Cajun branding of all things South Louisiana and instead promoted Creole branding at least in part because it is inclusive for both Whites and Blacks.
    Their approach is however not a simple revival of Creole as a synonym for native, as Eble claimed, but rather as inclusive of anyone who has European ancestors regardless of whether they also have African and/or American Indian ancestors \parencite{partsch_creole_2015}.
    The reclamation is rather a partial deracialization of the term, partial as European hegemony is a part of what constitutes White hegemony in the US.

    % Recent definitions of Creole identity by Creoles themselves are often racialized
      % For Creoles, Susberry (2004) divides their historical development as a group into 4 stages: 1) dissonance, 2) struggle for validation, 3) negotiation of group identity, and 4) activism (8)
        % At each stage, factors influencing Creoles' self-conceptualizations included 1) physical appearance, 2) low social status of Blacks, 3) negative treatment by Whites and Blacks, and 4) members' consciousness of the group's sociopolitical evolution (Susberry 2004:8)
      
  \section{The history of Cajuns}
    \label{sec:cajun_history}
    The history of Cajuns in Louisiana is intimately tied to that of the Acadians who resided in what is now Nova Scotia.
    This link exists both in fact and imagination.
    Indeed, the expulsion of the Acadians from Canada in the 18th century, called the \foreign{Grand dérangement}, is central to the origin story of the Cajuns of Louisiana today so much so that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \titlebook{Evangeline} romanticized the expulsion of the Acadians from Canada and is well known in South Louisiana for this reason despite the main character only spending a very short amount of time in the state \parencite{ross_evangeline_1991}.
    The term \lexi{Cajun} itself is derived from French \lexi{Acadien}, both the form with and without the initial vowel being used at various times in history for various reasons \parencite{henry_acadien_1998}, a fact that any French-speaking Cajun today will likely be able to reiterate.
    % Alveolar stops before vowels and especially /j/ are affricated in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:77)

    The Acadians themselves arrived in North America from mainly the western parts of France, namely Poitou, Aunis, Saintonge, and Angoumois \parencite{massignon_parlers_1962}, though it is unlikely that their ancestry remained purely French.
    Their first settlement, Port Royal, was founded in 1605 \parencite[p.~17]{massignon_parlers_1962}, establishing them in a region already occupied by American Indians such as the Mi'kmaq.
    While there is still much to uncover about the relationship between the French Acadians and the Mi'kmaq,, what textual evidence that has been analyzed as well as the demographic realities of colonial life that would have left few options for the creation of families make it ``highly likely'' that Mi'kmaqs were assimilated as Acadians and vice versa \parencite[pp.~22-25]{griffiths_contexts_1992}.
    Regardless, the people of this region who came to be called Acadians were suspected of being loyal to France after the territory came into British power with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.
    The British had insisted that they swear an oath of allegiance to Britian instead.
    The refusal of the Acadians to do did little to assuage suspicions, and by 1755 they were forcibly exiled from their home \parencite{faragher_great_2005}.

    Those Acadians who ended up settling in Louisiana did not arrive directly from Acadia.
    For instance, 1,508 had returned to France who did not necessarily want them back.
    Louisiana by this time was controlled by Spain, and Spain's ambassador in Paris, Count de Aranda, was charged with removing the Acadians from France and settling them in Louisiana \parencite[p.~109]{winzerling_acadian_1955}.
    Being once again forced to relocate may have helped create tensions between the Spanish and the Acadians as as some of those who would end up in the areas outside of New Orleans joined an insurrection in the city against the Spanish colonists in favor of the French in 1768 \parencite[p.~39]{texada_administration_1968}.
    The Acadians relocated from France, along with roughly 1,200 to 1,500 others eventually landed in Louisiana, initially settling in the Attakapas, the Acadian Coast along the Mississippi, and Natchez \parencite[pp.~74-78/91-100]{brasseaux_foundings_1987}.
    The distance between Natchez and the Acadian Coast is roughly 250 miles, covering a large amount of rural South Louisiana.
    Being able to connect one lineage to some degree to these early families was an important criteria for claiming Cajun identity up to at least the end of the 20th century \parencite[p.~184]{ryon_conflit_2000}, although those lines of descent are not often straightforward, as will be discussed shortly.
      
    Whereas the Creole myth discussed in section \ref{sec:creole_history} characterized Creoles of the past as aristocratic, the picture of Cajuns has been consistently of an impoverished people.
    In his journey through Louisiana in the first half of the 19th century, \parencite{olmsted_journey_1904} was told that the ``Acadians'' whose ``hamlet of cottages'' they passed were ``poor white, French Creoles'' (p.~342).
    This use of \lexi{Creole} suggests that the term was applied to more Acadians/Cajuns than Alexandre Mouton as previously mentioned \parencite{tregle_early_1952, tregle_that_1982} but to Acadians/Cajuns in general.
    Importantly, however, Cajuns were not rich Creoles at all.
    Accounts made by traveling Northerners after the war described ``Acadians'' as white trash, poor, uneducated, lazy, primitive, unambitious to where, by the late 19th century, Americans used the term \lexi{Cajun} to describe any poor person of French descent \parencite[pp.~101-104]{brasseaux_acadian_1992}.
    Indeed, \lexi{Cajun} had become a derogatory word, as \textcite{ralph_along_1893}, during his travels in Louisiana, was warned not to call (White) Acadians in Bayou Têche ``Cajun'' without the \orth{A} as this would be considered an insult (p.~883).
    
    While it is clear that a stigma was being attached to Cajuns already by the 19th century based on their low socioeconomic status, especially when using the localized version of their name, Cajuns were not an entirely homogenous group.
    Even in terms of their financial situations, while many were poor, some were sufficiently well off that they owned enslaved people.
    The first such documentation of this was as early as the 1770s \parencite[p.~191]{brasseaux_foundings_1987}.
    Census records from the 1850s in Lafayette Parish suggest that this practice continued and became relatively normal for Cajuns, although most who owned enslaved people own very few of them \parencite{baker_patterns_1974}.
    Additionally, while it has been argued that Cajuns in the 19th century were not very successful at forming sociopolitical alliances with other groups \parencite[p.~27]{johnson_louisiana_1976}, exogamous marriages did occur.
    Cajun women outnumbered Cajun men up to at least the Civil War and so often married non-Cajun men.
    In Terrebonne-Lafourche, as many as 40\% of the Cajun women who married chose men from outside their group such as Germans.
    As a result, their family names changed to non-Acadian names or even non-French names, yet their children were still raised as Cajuns \parencite[pp.~38-39/106]{brasseaux_acadian_1992}, hence how some early Cajun families ended up with unexpected names when conceptualizing Cajun as those with Acadian ancestry.

    By the early 20th century, the image of Cajuns as poor was still the primary one.
    For example, \textcite{smith_influence_1939} argued that Cajuns lacked mobility largely due to their status as poor farmers (p.~198).
    Indeed, immobility and isolation had also become central to characterizations of Cajuns by that time to such an extent that it was argued that this had led them to be ``probably the largest unassimilated nationality group in America'' \parencite[p.~82]{gilmore_social_1933}.
    It is doubtful that Gilmore's use of ``nationality'' for Cajuns was meant to imply that they were a politically organized ethnic group in his view as sociologists use the term today but rather to imply that Cajuns were culturally foreigners in relation to other Americans.
    As far as \textcite{smith_influence_1939}, that was a sort of French nationality as they highlighted both being francophone and being ``of French descent,'' be it Acadian or otherwise, in their definition of Cajuns (p.~198).

    While Acadian ancestry never quite disappeared as a criteria for claiming Cajun membership, cultural factors came to be highlighted more by the 1970s.
    For \textcite{del_sesto_culture_1975}, for instance, Cajuns were Louisianians who were Catholic, rural, privileged kinship relationships, and spoke or at least knew speakers of French.
    They explicitly suggested that Cajuns were not only those whose ancestors were expelled from Acadia but also others who had been incorporated into the group over time (p.~3).
    \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} went even further, claiming that ``someone who calls himself a Cajun today is no longer necessarily of Acadian ancestry,'' basing this on all of her participants claiming Cajun identity even though those from Avoyelles being of European ancestry and those from Pierre Part being of Acadian ancestry (pp.~18-20/22).
    It is unclear how she established the ancestry of her participants, although Avoyelles is just north of the areas where \textcite{brasseaux_foundings_1987} had shown that the Acadians initially settled.
    This does not mean that Acadians never spread north over time, however, which exemplifies the murkiness of using ancestry to establish Cajun membership and perhaps the reason why geneaology is such a prevalent topic for Louisianians today.

    In any case, Cajun membership has become easier to claim since the late 20th century.
    For one, the stigma that was once attached to Cajuns has transformed into pride since the 1970s through what has been dubbed the Cajun Renaissance.
    This movement was initially referred to as a ``renaissance du français'' \parencite[p.~40]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977} or a ``renaissance française''\footnote{
      Renaissance of French or French Renaissance, respectively.
    } \parencite[p.~205]{waddell_louisiane_1979}.
    Much of the initial revalorization efforts were focused on the French language in Louisiana \parencite{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}, a variety that was branded Cajun to the exclusion of Creoles, Indians, and others just as their role has been excluded from many other aspects of Louisiana culture \parencite{giancarlo_dont_2019}.
    The Renaissance itself has come to be labeled Cajun (\foreign{e.g.}, \citeauthor{dubois_when_1999}, \citeyear[p.~305]{dubois_when_1999}; \citeauthor{glain_cajun_2021}, \citeyear{glain_cajun_2021}), perhaps as a result of the diminished role of F\&C in the state as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:fc_status}.
    Indeed, \textcite{ryon_conflit_2000} found that, among college students at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, French fluency was a sufficient criteria for Cajun membership, especially among men, but not a necessary criteria as 63\% of men and 42\% of women who identified as Cajun did not speak French with their families (pp.~180-182).
    Similarly, \citeauthor{tornquist_attitudes_2000}'s (\citeyear{tornquist_attitudes_2000}) survey of parents of French immersion students showed that 58\% of the parents who identified as Cajun spoke French (p.~188), meaning 42\% of the Cajun parents who valued the language enough to send their children to French immersion schools were unable to speak the language themselves.
    While efforts to re-establish pride in French in Louisiana started with the language, as the language continued to decline in importance, this newfound pride was instead projected on to Cajun identity in general.
    The movement has been successful enough that, by the 1990s, \textcite{rottet_language_1995} found the Cajuns of Terrebonne-Lafourche with whom he worked to no longer be stigmatized (p.~110).

    Today, cultural factors have continued to be used for defining Cajuns, but Cajun is also discussed as something along the line of a panethnicity \parencite{omi_racial_1997}.
    \textcite{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012} suggested that one could be Cajun through associations with foodways, music, the French language, ``and until recently, the Catholic faith,'' all of which she claimed could also be used as valid criteria for Creole membership (p.~280).
    Likewise, \citeauthor{ryon_conflit_2000}'s (\citeyear{ryon_conflit_2000}) college students also reported foodways and religion as important factors for claiming Cajun identity (p.~184).
    The similarity in what cultural features can be used for establishing Cajun and Creole membership is notable, however, as it has provided room for major racial categories from the US to be applied to these local categories.
    As already discussed in section \ref{sec:creole_history}, for many, Cajun has come to be more or less a synonym for White and Creole for not White.
    On the Cajun side, while being inclusive of essentially all White South Louisianians has perhaps provided the group with greater robustness and sociopolitical power, as is sometimes the motivation for other groups that come together to form a panethnicity, as \textcite{giancarlo_dont_2019} put it, it also ``minimizes a diversity of white ethnicities'' (p.~33) essentially through a form of erasure \parencite{irvine_language_2000}.
    Indeed, as one of \citeauthor{trepanier_cajunization_1991}'s (\citeyear{trepanier_cajunization_1991}) respondents from Breaux Bridge resentfully stated in 1981, ``On s'appelait des Créoles avant cette affaire de Cadjin''\footnote{
      We called ourselves Creoles before this Cajun business.
    } (p.~167).
    While all those born in South Louisiana were at one time Creoles including Cajuns, a realignment has occurred where these two categories are mutually exclusive and more in accord with the the broader US binary of White ersus non-White.
        
    % A similar change towards a reduced importance of ancestry has been occurring with Acadian identity in the Maritime Provinces where membership was once based on ancestry but now more broadly includes any francophone living in these provinces (Arrighi 2014:110)
    % All this isn't to say that ancestry is important in how Cajuns IMAGINE membership works until they are reminded that those with non-Acadian names also identify as Cajun
      % Moerman (1965), in his study of the Lue in Thailand, argued that ethnic membership comes simply from people perceiving themselves as belonging to the same ethnic category (as cited in Eriksen 1993/2010:15-16)
        % This has been echoed by others (Giles 1979:252-253; Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:2)
  \section{The status of F\&C in Louisiana}
    \label{sec:fc_status}
    French fluency is not simply a factor that helps one claim Creole or Cajun membership but rather the glottonym Creoles and Cajuns choose for what they speak is entangled with their self-identifications regardless of the structural qualities of their speech.
    In St Landry Parish, an area from which much of the data for the present study comes, it was found that those who identified as Cajuns called their language French whereas those who identified as Creoles called their language Creole even when some Creoles used linguistic features typically marked as French and some Cajuns used those typically marked as Creole \parencite{klingler_language_2003}.
    In light of this intimate connections with identity and language in Louisiana, the linguistic focus of here is on F\%C.
    It is thus important to situate the status of French and Creole in the state.

    The arrival of F\&C in Louisiana is started simply with the colonization of the region by the French.
    This early group of Europeans have been dubbed \foreign{l'ancienne population}\footnote{The old/former population.}, who were followed by the arrival of several other major francophone groups at different times: \foreign{les Français étrangers}\footnote{The foreign French.}, the Acadians, and those coming from Saint-Domingue\footnote{Present-day Haiti.} \parencite[p.~19]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
    Indeed, while the bulk of early colonists came from Île-de-France and Brittany \parencite[pp.~15-17]{brasseaux_french_2005}, immigration of French speakers continued even after the Louisiana Purchase up to the Civil War \parencite[p.~99]{fortier_french_1884}. % No source for any of these facts. Verify in Brasseaux 1990 maybe.
    This includes the even the period of Spanish rule from 1762 to 1800.
    As already covered in section \ref{sec:cajun_history}, the Acadians arrived in Louisiana primarily during this time, for example, but also those who immigrated in response to the French Revolution\footnote{
      The bulk of this latter group came just after 1800 when Spain gave over control of Louisiana, but it started while Spain was still in power.
    } \parencite{lachance_new_1989}.
    For those coming directly from France during this time the bulk came from Guyenne and Provence in the south of France, groups that made up an insignificant portion of early French colonists \parencite[p.~22]{brasseaux_french_2005}.
    % Louisiana was claimed in 1682 by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle of French Canada (Neumann 1985:8)
      % Louisiana wasn't really explored and colonized until 1698 by Pierre Le Moyne (Sieur d'Iberville) and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne (Sieur de Bienville) (Neumann 1985:8)

    It is often maintained at least implicitly that Acadian French is the primary origin of the variety of French spoken in rural Louisiana.
    This idea has been challenged at least when applied to the entirety of South Louisiana \parencite{mathis-moser_how_2009}, mostly along demographic lines.
    For instance, in Avoyelles Parish and Pointe Coupée Parish at the fringes of where the Acadians initially settled, Cajuns made up only 1.6\% and 1.8\% of the population, respectively \parencite[p.~107]{brasseaux_acadian_1992}.
    On the other hand, Cajuns also outnumbered immigrants from France along Bayou Lafourche ten to one in 1870 \parencite[p.~168]{brasseaux_acadian_1992}, suggesting that in some regions of Louisiana, Acadians did in fact play an important role in the development of French in the state.
    Likewise, as \textcite{brown_pronominal_1988} argued, Acadian solidarity may have also provided them with outsized influence even where they were a minority of the population (pp.~21-22).
    Indeed, the population that arrived before the Acadians was not terribly cohesive in terms of cultural backgrounds and was often ephemeral.
    % Esman (1985) guessed that only 5% of the population of Louisiana in the 1980s had Acadian ancestry based on family names (7-8)
    % In fact, Arrighi (2014), a researcher focused on Acadian French, has even argued that data from Louisiana should be excluded from descriptions in the literature of "français acadien" (107)

    Another notable group of French-speaking immigrants that came to Louisiana slightly later were those from Saint-Domingue.
    Linguistically, there are implications for the development of Creole in Louisiana as some of those who arrived from Saint-Domingue may have brought there own Creole with them.
    Indicative of this are some of the Lomax recordings of songs in 1937 in New Orleans that contain syntactic structures reminiscent of Haitian Creole but not Louisiana Creole such as \foreign{Papa moin couru la rivière}\footnote{
      My father went to the river.
    } where the possessive determiner \lexi{moin} is postnominal rather than prenominal as it would be in Louisiana (\foreign{i.e.}, \foreign{Mon papa}) \parencite{klingler_creole_2024}.
    Over 10,000 people landed in New Orleans from Saint-Domingue in 1809 and 1810, making up the bulk of this group \parencite[p.~247]{brasseaux_1809_1992}.
    Work on surnames has suggested that there were additionally immigrants from this group who settled all across rural Louisiana in the 18th century as far west and north as Natchitoches \parencite[p.~23]{brasseaux_tortue_1992}, although it has not been clearly established to what degree if at all the French or Creole spoken by these immigrants contributed to the character of F\&C in rural Louisiana.
    % In 1788, the racial demographics of Saint-Domingue included approximately 28,000 Whites, 22,000 free people of color, and 405,000 enslaved people (Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:50, citing the census)
    % Haitian independence was achieved in 1804 (Le Page & Tabouret 1985:50)

    By all accounts, French, Creole, and English were all widely spoken in Louisiana throughout the 19th century thanks to factors such as this continued francophone immigration.
    Indeed, the Louisiana legislature had appointed interpreters in order to deal with the multilingual nature of the state \parencite[pp.~97-98]{fortier_french_1884}.
    Starting with the Louisiana constitution of 1812, English was the official language of in which legislation was to be written \parencite{bush_first_1975}, but due to the fact that many in the legislature spoke only French, deliberations in French were tolerated \parencite[p.~33]{smith-thibodeaux_francophones_1977}.
    This continued in such a regular fashion that the 1845 constitution was written in both English and French and required the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to be bilingual \parencite[p.~12]{louisiana_constitution_1845}.
    Newspapers in French also suggest that the general public was literate in the language.
    These began being published in 1794 with \titlebook{Le Moniteur de la Louisiane}, and many others followed including perhaps the most famous, \titlebook{L'Abeille}, as well as \titlebook{L'Ami des ois}, \titlebook{Le Courrier de la Louisiane}, and \titlebook{Le Propagateur catholique}.
    \titlebook{L'Abeille} was not discontinued until 1925, and the last French-language newspaper was \titlebook{Le Courrier de la Nouvelle-Orléans} which was printed from 1902 until 1955 \parencite[p.~22]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
    Other newspapers declined at the end of the 19th century, such as those in Pointe Coupée that ceased being published in 1872 \parencite[p.~108]{klingler_if_2003}
    % Even as late as the 1970s, the bilingual Acadiana Profile was launched (J. Johnson 1976:29), but this was clearly a niche item at that point
    % As I mentioned elsewhere, there were efforts to unify around language between the Louisiana Purchase and Civil War to resist the influence of "American" immigrants (J. Johnson 1976:20)

    French was ever-present enough in writing and day-to-day interactions that there are accounts that explicitly lay out language ideologies towards the various varieties used.
    In general, \textcite{fortier_french_1884} found the French of Louisiana to have a certain ``purity'' which he believed to be to due to the men of rich families having almost always been educated in France ``during the old regime.''
    As such, those francophones of little means were not seen in such a positive light.
    He particularly complained about Cajuns who degraded the language, in his view.
    He provided examples of their speech that were ``not very elegant'' such as the use of \lexi{je} as a first person plural subject pronoun, \lexi{paré} for \gloss{ready} rather than \lexi{prêt}, and \lexi{il mouille} for \gloss{it is raining} rather than \lexi{il pleut} (p.~99).
    Just as being a Cajun in the 19th century had become akin to being poor an uneducated, so was their language considered.
    % 1pl je is in fact a feature found even now in Acadian French (King 2000; Comeau & King 2007, both cited in King 2008:140)

    The decline of French in Louisiana, however, occurred most rapidly in the big city of New Orleans rather than in the rural areas populated by Cajuns.
    
    % 20th century
      % Numbers
        % The decline became rapid after 1900 in New Orleans and especially after WWI (J. Johnson 1976:22), though he gives no sources for this
          % The last holdouts were unemployed wives up until WWI (J. Johnson 1976:22)
          % Elsewhere the decline has not been nearly as rapid
            % H. Smith & Phillips (1939), while studying Evangeline Parish, reported that 90% of South Louisiana spoke French (198)
              % This was probably a guess, but the extremely high percentage suggests that it was so prevalent as to feel like it was everywhere
        % J. Johnson (1976) describes Cajuns in particular as being rather isolated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in comparison with other francophone populations, resulting in their greater continued use of French (28)
          % Conrad (1978) outlined four driving forces behind the Americanization of Cajuns: 1) compulsory education, 2) mass communication, 3) World War II, and 4) the oil boom (as cited in B. Brown 1988:28)
            % With this Americanization came less isolation and greater use of English
            % Neumann (1985) specifically argued that compulsory education and the oil boom were behind the shift from Creole to English (49)
          % Highway connections
            % Even by J. Johnson's time, it was estimated that 60% of Cajuns lived in rural areas (Bobo & Charlton 1974, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:27)
            % Gold (1976) suggests that, for Mamou, isolation from Lake Charles and Lafayette only diminished after highways were built (268)
            % Those living in swamp areas didn't have highways until the 1950s, some in Bayou Lafourche were still going to school by boat in the 1970s, and I-10 was not completed until 1975 (B. Brown 1988:26-27, possibly citing Padgett 1969 for the first two points)
          % Likewise, Pointe Coupee Creole was in part maintained due to 19th century residents being insular to the point of marrying cousins as a norm (Klingler 2003 "Turn":109)
          % Likewise again, during segregation, Indians weren't allowed in White schools but also refused to go to Black schools (Rottet 1995:61-62)
            % This highlights the isolation of French-speaking communities, how that isolation can help maintain the language as Indians were maintaining it better than others in their area, and how a racial binary was impacting that those didn't fit neatly into either category
        % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, the decline in French has been said to have started in the 1940s (Western 1971, as cited in Rottet 1995:105)
          % It has been argued that the decline in French in Lafourche Parish in the 1940s came from most people working in the oil industry as it developed there were from North Louisiana or Texas and so the locals saw these non-Cajuns as gaining wealth and attributed their own poverty to their ethnicity (Larouche 1981, as cited in Rottet 1995:105)
        % Rottet (1995) explained that census numbers are sometimes misleading as glossonyms may be more or less specific than what residences expect, leading to misunderstanding (B. Brown 1993, as cited in Rottet 1995:98), and the questions have changed at different times such as the 1970 census asking about the childhood home language whereas the 1990 census asked what language is currently spoken at home (Rottet 1995:112-113)
          % On the 1970 census, 572,262 Louisianians reported French as their mothertongue (as cited in J. Johnson 1976:19/36 and in Neumann 1985:16)
            % CODOFIL itself estimated much higher around this time: 1.5 million (J. Johnson 1976:36)
        % When looking at children, there's a repeated pattern of decline
          % Among all children in Evangeline Parish and Pointe Coupee Parish in 1960, it was estimated that, as children, 38% spoke French, 53% spoke English, and 9% spoke both (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:32)
            % Among Black children in Evangeline Parish and Pointe Coupee Parish in 1960, it was estimated that 31% had a French background and 69% an English (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:33)
            % 68% of those in Evangeline and Pointe Coupee who spoke French during their childhood still spoke it frequently as adults in 1960 (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in Rottet 1995:113-114)
          % The 1980 census estimated the percentage of those who speak French at home in Avoyelles and Assumption Parishes was 45% and 30%, respectively, when looking at those 18 or older, but 13% and 7% for those between 5 and 17 (as cited in B. Brown 1988:79)
          % Trépanier (1988) reported 41% of respondents saying that they spoke French best whereas those respondents reported that 92% of their grandparents, 84% of their parents, and 3% of their children spoke French best (as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
          % CODOFIL carried out another survey later that estimated that 40.6% based on the 8 parishes surveyed, 42.5% of those people being over 45 and 24% being under 19 (Henry 1990, as cited in Rottet 1995:115-116)
        % By the 1980s, French was in decline towards English in all regions except 1) Southwest Louisiana, 2) Pigeon and Pierre Part, and 3) Lower Lafourche and Terrebonne where bilingualism was the norm (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
          % Smith-Thibodeaux (1977) estimated 300,000 to 500,000 (as cited in Rottet 1995:113)
          % Neumann (1985) estimated 500,000 to 1 million, additionally estimating 60,000 to 80,000 Creole speakers (as cited in Rottet 1995:113)
          % French was the mothertongue of 35% of the population of Houma, 39% of Thibodeaux, and 60% of rural Terrebonne-Lafourche (1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
          % Rottet (1995) didn't find any monolingual French speakers in Terrebonne-Lafourche (162)
            % Not long before this in the 1970s, Gibson & Del Sesto (1975) suspected that some older Louisianians still used French exclusively, though they didn't make it clear if they meant these people were monolinguals (7)
      % Cultural indicators
        % Politics
          % The language of instruction of public schools was set as English only in the early part of the 20th century (Constitution of the State of Louisiana 1921:93, Section 12)
            % In fact, not a single mention of the word French appears though several mentions of English as a requirement for certain posts appear
            % This is similar to the turning points for other minority languages
              % In New Zealand, Maori was banned from schools in the mid 19th century (Bell 2014:62-63)
          % As I mentioned elsewhere, Edwin Edwards, in 1971, became the first French-speaking governor elected since the Civil War (J. Johnson 1976:29)
          % Act no 256, pushed for by CODOFIL, made French a co-official language in the state with English (Rottet 1995:106)
          % Act no 263 allowed local governments to replace English highway signs with English-French bilingual signs (Ortego & Lafleur 2014)
        % It has been reported generally that Cajuns had taken "great pride" in their language by the 1970s, hence the establishment of CODOFIL in 1968 (J. Johnson 1976:28)
          % CODOFIL did not promote French among Black and Indian Louisianians, which has led to criticism that it cultivated the identity of French Louisianians as White (Waddell 1983, as cited in Rottet 1995:109)
        % Education and immersion programs
          % Cajuns had access to "two years of elective French courses in high school" (H. Smith & Phillips 1939:199) even though regular instruction was already outlawed by that time
            % Much later in the 20th century, this access in high school was said to be decreasing (Landry et al. 1996, as cited in Lindner 2008:39)
          % CODOFIL was bringing in an estimated 200 foreign francophone teachers each year to teach roughly 40,000 students (J. Johnson 1976:29)
            % Importantly, these teachers were using textbooks from France (J. Johnson 1976:28)
              % Through the 20th century at least, there was only one textbook based on Louisiana French, the variety of Vermilion by Faulk (1977), but it was never used in schools (Rottet 1995:110)
          % Immersion programs began in 1979 in Baton Rouge, and by 1994 there were programs in Lafayette, Orleans, Assumption, Calcasieu, and St Martin (Rottet 1995:107)
          % By 1993, there were 80,000 or more immersion school students and most teachers were native Louisianians (650 of the 825) (Acadiana Profile, as cited in Rottet 1995:107)
          % Benton (2008) reported that 900 of the 30,000 students (3%) in the Lafayette Parish school district were in immersion schooling (as cited in Lindner 2008:45-46)
            % French immersion was available in Lafayette Parish from kindergarten to 8th grade, though after 5th grade, immersion was only for half the day (Lindner 2008:67)
          % Schools technically had to offer 5 years of French but could be granted an exception via a simple request for one (Acadiana Profile 1970, as cited in Rottet 1995:106)
          % Much of CODOFIL's efforts have been focused on school immersion programs
            % It has been argued that, for language revitalization, focusing on schools is helpful but has a limited impact (Hornberger & King 1996, as cited in Rindstedt & Aronsson 2002:723)
              % Fishman (1991) likewise argued that schools alone aren't enough for revitalizing language in that "'it still requires extensive and recurring pre-school, out-of-school and post-school societal reinforcement, particularly if its initiatory efforts are to become cumulative and intergenerationally transmissible'" (as cited in Lindner 2008:17-18)
                % This is indeed what has been seen with Breton in Brittany as it's still in decline despite having education programs (Gemie 2002, as cited in Lindner 2008:25)
              % This is perhaps doubly true for non-immersion language education, as Bankston & Henry (2002) claimed that, among those students, only "'very few have achieved fluency or even developed an interest in the language'" by the end of the 1990s (as cited in Lindner 2008:43)
            % Educators in general have also been argued to be effectively pushing towards a standard which sometimes means "the rejection of the norms of home usage," as Le Page (1968) found in Creole-speaking countries (as cited in Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:184)
              % A similar issue in Louisiana programs not only because Hexagonal French could be promoted over Louisiana French but even Louisiana French over Louisiana Creole
        % Media
          % Media that glorifies a dominant language and culture has been seen to spur on the decline of Dyirbal in Australia (Schmidt 1985) and Nahuatl in Mexico (Hill & Hill 1977, as cited in Rottet 1995:21-22)
          % Shortly after the establishment of CODOFIL in 1968 (About CODOFIL 2023), said founding largely due to efforts of James Domengeaux (Gold 1982, as cited in Lindner 2008:39-40), the Louisiana legislature launched Télévision-Louisiane as a non-profit French-language television broadcasting corporation (J. Johnson 1976:29)
          % Louisiana Public Broadcasting (LPB) broadcast the French-language talk show En Français 4 hours per week (Rottet 1995:108)
          % Rottet's (1995) participants in Terrebonne-Lafourche reported listening to French music on the radio but only a handful listened to the limited amount of French talk broadcasts available (146-147)
        % Writing
          % The written language has been argued to help generate a national consciousness (Anderson 1983/2006:44-45)
            % Generating sociolinguistic consciousness is likewise possible
          % As I mentioned elsewhere, the bilingual newspaper the Acadiana Profile began being published in the 1970s (J. Johnson 1976:29)
          % Most but not all of Rottet's (1995) participants were illiterate in French, 10 of 71 reporting reading at least rarely (146)
          % Only 3 of Rottet's (1995) participants wrote letters in French, 2 older and 1 middle (146)
          % Only 2 of Blainey's (2013) 33 participants in Golden Meadows were literate due to having some "very limited" self-taught knowledge (71)
        % Religion
          % In 1920, 1/3rd of Catholic churches in Acadiana held services in French, but that number shrank to just 3 by the 1980s (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:103-104)
          % In 1981, 27% of Baptist churches in Acadiana "used French at least occasionally" (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:104)
      % 20th century projections
        % Given the general decline in numbers over time, it's not surprising that researchers have been projecting the demise of French for a while
          % For Cajuns, Bernard (2003) reported that those who speak French as a first language has declined from 83% in the early 1900s to 21% between 1956 and 1960 to 3% in 1980 (as cited in Lindner 2008:37)
          % Rottet (2001) reported that in Terrebonne-Lafourche, 31% of those over 55 spoke French to their children, 10% of those between  30 and 54, and none of those under 30 (as cited in Lindner 2008:38)
        % J. Johnson (1976) predicted, using crude methods, that native French-speaking families in Louisiana would cease to exist by 2010 (34-35)
          % This has not panned out, but the consensus is generally that the language is disappearing, perhaps through through Campbell & Muntzel's (1989) concept of gradual language death rather than radical language death (as cited in Bell 2014:89) as earlier projections seemed ready to announce
        % B. Brown (1988) considered conclusions about the inevitable death of French in Louisiana as "premature" in light of the Cajun renaissance (48-49) which will be discussed more in the meaning chapter
        % Rottet (1995) believed that the communities in Terrebonne-Lafourche are going through a language shift (6) and wagered that the prospects for French were "much better than for Louisiana French Creole" but "not particularly good" (112)
          % A language shift is the process by which a speech community of a language comes to speak a different langauge to the exclusion of the first (Weinreich 1953/1967:68/94-95)
          % Indeed, Rottet (1995) shows that there is a shift from using almost always French in all social contexts to mostly English (137-138)
          % This is constrained by ethnicity where Cajuns have increased their use of French in some contexts but decreased in others whereas Indians have decreased in all contexts (Rottet 1995:139)
            % This feels likely due to where the starting point is since French was more prevalent for Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche and even being passed on to children still (Rottet 1995:71)
          % Neumann (1985) reported that creolophones in Breaux Bridge used the language only with «des amis ou des personnes de même niveau social» (25)
          % B. Brown (1988) specifically looked for and found participants who preferred French in all domains in Avoyelles and Assumption (70)
          % The shrinking domains of use that Rottet (1995) reported were just prior to his study reported by CODOFIL where they estimated that almost all French interactions are with friends and family as opposed to the workplace (and by extension public uses in general) (Henry 1990, as cited in Rottet 1995:115-116)
          % A shrinking number of contexts is what one expects for endangered languages
            % In Wisconsin West Frisian, a heritage language, the language is limited to "social gatherings among the remaining speakers" (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:237)
            % This is essentially what J. Fishman (1967/2000) was talking about when he said that the existence of widespread individual bilingualism without diglossia generally implies a transitional period (79)
              % There is still arguably widespread bilingualism in Louisiana, but diglossia let alone diglossia where French is dominant is certainly not a thing that exists today
                % Neumann (1985) in her time even reported that diglossia was not a thing because younger people simply always used English (27-28)
              % Ferguson (1959/2000) suggested the (national) circumstances needed for a diglossic situation to disappear: 1) widespread literacy, 2) broader communication between segments of the community, and 3) a push for "a full-fledged standard 'national' language" (70)
                % Louisianians have become more literate in English, developed more communication with those outside of the South Louisiana communities, and a national language has been being pushed since Theodore Roosevelt at least
    % 21st century indications
      % Marcoux et al. (2022) estimated that there are about 84,000 French speakers in Louisiana (128)
      % We could perhaps talk about F&C as heritage languages at this point
        % Heritage language definitions
          % A language "acquired as an L1 in a natural setting, typically in the home or the community" (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:235)
      % It has been claimed that English was dominant in "French Louisiana" (Blyth 1997; Valdman 1997, both as cited in B. Brown 2003:4)
      % Gudmestad & Carmichael (2022) had a number of study participants (Indians) who were native speakers in their 30s (in 2007-2008) in Terrebonne-Lafourche (6-7)
      % Lindner (2008) studied high school students in her work on attitudes towards Louisiana French because they were expected to be the last generation of Louisianians exposed to French from their families (5-6)
      % As for Creole, which may or may not be included in counts, which sometimes is and sometimes isn't made clear
        % As Marshall (1996) pointed out, the label Cajun is generally used for "anyone who speaks French or has some French heritage" despite there being many different groups who speak French or Creole in the state (as cited in Lindner 2008:51)
        % Neumann (1985) estimated 60,000 to 80,000 at the time of which she also estimated 50,000 to 60,000 were Black, respectively (20)
        % Klingler (2005) estimated that there were less than 30,000 Creole speakers (351), but it's not clear what that number is based on
    \subsection{Defining a language as a Creole}
      % Indeed, Creole often appears as an afterthought when discussing the status of "French" in Louisiana, so it is appropriate to spend some time here specifically outlining its place
      % There have been attempts to define creoles as distinctive due to shared structural features
        % McWhorter (2011) offered 4 linguistic features that would also indicate that creoles develop from pidgins, but at least Aboh & deGraff (2017) reject this (14)
          % Aboh & deGraff (2017), based on many examples, instead argue that the linguistic structure these languages take on is always based on the languages that are in contact (16)
        % This often means arguing that creoles are simpler than other languages
          % It has been argued as a counter-example that Haitian Creole NPs are more complex than both French and Gbe NPs (Aboh & deGraff 2017:12)
      % But what makes a creole is the sociohistorical circumstances of its development
        % Mintz (1971) suggested that creoles only come about if the right conditions are met for demographics, social relationships, and the community setting (481)
        % Historically, the argument has been that creoles develop from pidgins, so the the conditions needed for pidgins were the right ones
          % Mufwene (2008) argued that this is incorrect, citing Chaudenson's gradual basilectalization idea as being correct, apparently under the assumption that there was always a homestead stage (10)
        % In the colonial period, slavery was much more prevalent in the south (39.8% of pop) than the the middle colonies (7.0%) and New England (3.1%) (Franklin & Moss 1988, as cited in Rickford 1997:320)
          % Bickert (1981) has argued that as much as 80% of the population needs to be substrate speakers for a creole to emerge (as cited in Rickford 1997:317)
    \subsection{Historical development of Creole in Louisiana}
      % Where did Creole come from in the first place
        % Slavery
          % There were initially 5,310 enslaved people brought to Louisiana in the early 1700s from The Senegal Concession (Sierra Leone in the south to Mauritania in the north), the Gulf of Benin, and Angola (Cabinda specifically) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":6)
            % 1719 was the first year, and most were Bambara with some being Wolof and some Serer (Usner 1992, as cited in Rottet 1995:91)
          % Enslaved people made up 41% of the population in 1726 and 60% in 1732 (Rottet 1995:91)
          % When the Spanish took over Louisiana in 1762 up until 1800, the number of enslaved people in Louisiana increased from ~4,600 to ~24,000 (G. M. Hall 1992:279)
            % Of the roughly 55% of those whose origins are know during this time, they were 55% African, 37% Creole (born in the Louisiana), and 4% from English-speaking regions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":20-21)
          % In 1788 in Pointe Coupee, enslaved people outnumbered free people by about 3 to 1 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":103)
          % The foreign importation of enslaved people was banned in 1804 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":67)
            % Enslaved people could still be moved from elsewhere in the US to Louisiana
          % By 1860, 76% of the large plantations (more than 50 enslaved people) in Pointe Coupee were owned by "Americans" (Costello 1999, as cited in Klingler 2003 "Turn":107)
        % People who were enslaved and transported from Senagambia mainly spoke Malinke/Maninka, Serer, Wolof, or Pulaar (Klingler 2003 "Turn":57)
        % African languages may be responsible features such as (Klingler 2003 "Turn":62-66):
          % Predicate clefting in which an adjective is repeated in its usual location (e.g., Se malad li malad)
          % Preverbal markers
          % Frequent copula absence
          % Postnominal definite and demonstrative determiners
          % The plural postnominal definite article being identical to the 3pl subject pronoun
        % Who speaks it today generally
          % In Pointe Coupee, more Whites, because the influx of English speaking slaves brought to the area in the 19th century meant that black slaves often learned English before their white owners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":108)
    
    % \subsection{Regional and social variation in F\&C}
    %   \label{sec:reg_socio_variation}
      % Possessive forms such as noukenne (Fortier 1884:107)
        % Also attested in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":187-188)
        % These are only described in grammars of what is labeled Creole, but speakers who have otherwise almost none of the other features from those grammars certainly produce this form, as well
          % e.g., YouTube interview with Canray Fontenot, my interview with Patrick Patin (I think)
      % Qui has been attested as 'what' in Terrebonne-Lafourche, Vermilion, and Avoyelles (Papen & Rottet 1997:105)
      % Noun agglutinations
        % l-, n-, and z- can vary even within the speech of a single speaker in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":160)
        % Agglutinations are dropped when the noun is preceded by a preposition in fixed expressions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":162)
      % Post-posed articles
        % 19th century Creole in New Orleans
          % -la (sg), -layé (pl) (definite), -cila (sg), -cilayé (pl) (demonstrative) (Fortier 1884:105-106)
        % Pointe Coupee Creole speakers produced -la (sg) and -yé (pl) for definite determiners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":65/84/172)
        % St Tammany speakers produce -le (pl) definite determiners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":84)
        % Pointe Coupee Creole has -sa-la (sg) and -sa-ye (pl) for a demonstrative determiner and sometimes -sa (Klingler 2003 "Turn":65/181-182)
        % These aren't exclusive, as les is produced, as well
          % In Pointe Coupee, les generally comes before plural person nouns and time expressions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":174-175)
          % In Pointe Coupee, les is attested as being combined with -sa-ye (Klingler 2003 "Turn":182) and in Breaux Bridge with les + -sa-la(-la) is the most common form for the demonstrative (Klingler 2003 "Turn":183)
          % Similarly, in Pointe Coupee, des is sometimes produced as a plural indefinite article (Klingler 2003 "Turn":172)
          % In my own data, les appears to be the default, and instead -yé only occurs in possessive constructions, presumably because les is replaced by a possessive determiner, and possessive determiners for these speakers aren't marked for number
          % These cases are simply more examples of the blurring of the boundary between what one would call French vs Creole
      % Morphology
        % Number
          % Didn't exist in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":170)
          % In the Barataria-Terrebonne basin, B. Brown (2003) reported participants pronouncing a final -s to mark plural nouns (16-17)
      % Prepositions
        % From (i.e., out of) was expressed in Pointe Coupee Creole with dans, en-dans, or NULL (Klingler 2003 "Turn":356/360)
      % Non-subject pronouns
        % Preverbal en has been replaced by postverbal z'en for some speakers (Rottet 1995:218)
      % English influence
        % This is typical for many declining languages in contact with English
          % Romani in England has borrowed English grammar and vocabulary to the point where "only a few hundred words" from Romani remain (Bell 2014:91)
        % Louisiana isn't the only place where English has found its way into French, sometimes in similar ways to Louisiana in these other places
          % English was being used in Acadian French by the 1940s at least to the extent that borrowed verbs took inflections (Massignon 1962, as cited in King 2000:2)
          % Chiac in Dieppe in 1991 and 2000 has "back", "much", "but", and "so" among others (Perrot 2014) and SE New Brunswick in general (Roy 1979, as cited in King 2008)
            % "Back" was found in Prince Edward Island (King 2000, as cited in King 2008:161-162)
            % "Back" is also found in Ontario (Hull 1955; Canale et al. 1977, both cited in King 2008:158-159)
          % Quebec French (Poplack & Dion 2012)
        % Two Cajun women (73 and 88) from Gonzales produced code-switching in an interview (B. Brown 1986:401)
          % She characterized these women as speaking English and "Cajun"
          % She argues the English influence is on both a lexical and structural level (400)
          % Types: 54 emblematic vs 28 intimate, meaning most switches were single nouns, and 82 conversational vs 3 situational, meaning switches didn't involve changes in participants or subjects (403)
            % The emblematic switches often involve modern technologies (B. Brown 1986:400-401)
              % This is also the case in the Creole of Breaux Bridge, where English makes up most of the vocabulary for politics, economics, teaching, and other modern domains (Neumann 1985:71)
            % It's not always clear if such lone other-language items are code-switches or borrowings (Poplack & Dion 2012), so they've been referred to in various ways
              % Cultural borrowed forms (Myers-Scotton 1993/1997:169) or cultural code switch in (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:238)
                % Ehresmann & Bousquette (2015) establish this via deduction, which in their case of Wisconsin West Frisian, meant considering whether the referents existed by the time the speakers' ancestors had immigrated or not (239)
                  % This is a common explanation of which words get borrowed, for example Spanish speakers in Tampa, Florida borrowing a lot of baseball terms (Ortoz 1949, as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:52)
        % Lexical items
          % English borrowings go back at least as far as the 1930s in Evangeline Parish (H. Smith & Phillips 1939:199)
            % At this time, French was legally no longer allowed to be the language of instruction, so H. Smith & Phillips (1939) suggested that this was the source of English borrowings (198-199)
            % H. Smith & Phillips (1939) found most English borrowings in Evangeline Parish were nouns and verbs which could be pronounced as in English or using French phonology (199-201)
              % Nouns were also very common among Puerto Ricans in NYC (Poplack 1979/1980/2000:226)
            % Borrowed English verbs are either left bare or placed in the -er class in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:95)
              % I came across both strategies in my data
          % B. Brown (2003) found that English lexical borrowings occurred at a high rate among her participants in the Barataria-Terrebonne basin (3-4)
          % "So" as a conjunction in Terrebonne-Lafourche among both Cajuns and Indians (Rottet 1995:129)
          % "But" has been documented and analyzed in Terrebonne-Lafourche in 2006 (Dajko & Carmichael 2014)
          % Neumann (1985) claimed that decreolization along lexical and morphological lines was towards English (46)
          % Neumann (1985) claimed that English most influences Creole in its lexicon (70)
        % French also has influenced the English spoken in Louisiana, for example B. Brown's (1986) two participants produced phrases like "he went in France" and "I love gumbo, cher" (400)
          % Dubois & Horvath's (2003) study of "Cajun Vernacular English" had men producing phrases such as "Me I went to the store" and "I've been married with my wife during twenty years" (37)
          % "Mais" has been attested in the English of young non-francophones in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Dajko & Carmichael 2014:165)
            % This is doubly interesting since this study looked specifically at the use of "but" in French there
      % Geographic variation
        % Klingler (2005) found that speakers in Pointe Coupee used Creole-marked variants and in St Landry French-marked variants for 1sg pronouns, past perfective, and the verb 'to have' (354-356)
        % Almost all of the variants marked as Creole (by Klingler, 1sg subject pronouns, perfective aspect representation, and the verb 'to have') used by speakers in St Landry Parish were produced by 4 speakers from Leonville, Prairie Ville, and Arnaudville (Klingler 2003 "Language":83).
          % These towns are all along Bayou Teche which historically was lined with plantations (Klingler 2003 "Language":83)
          % Most variants were marked as French in general
          % Most Creole variants were also used by Blacks, though not exclusively (some White Cajuns used Creole-marked perfective aspect)
        % Almost all variants of 1sg pronouns, perfective aspect, and the verb 'to have' used by speakers in Pointe Coupee (3 Black, 2 White) were variants marked as Creole save for some tokens (~7%) of 'avoir' used only by Whites (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
          % For 1sg specifically, only 2 tokens were not mo, and those 2 tokens were null rather than je (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
      % Ethnic variation
        % Phonetic variation
          % J. Johnson (1976) claimed that Cajuns in the 1970s pronounced <oi> pronounced as [wɛ] and had distinct lexical features such as amarrer, haler, asteur, and English borrowings (31-32)
            % It's not clear why he mentions English borrowings for Cajuns as he does mention this for New Orleans Creoles, as well
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, the article les is produced as [lø] by Cajuns and [lo] by Indians (Rottet 1995:128)
        % Morphology
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Cajuns preferred /e/ on verbs to make them agree with vous whereas Indians preferred NULL endings regardless of whether vous was used as a singular or plural pronoun (Rottet 1995:194/199)
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Cajuns used the subjunctive more than Indians, though both had low usage (24% and 5%, respectively) (Rottet 1995:265)
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, both Cajuns and Indians produced agglutination, but Indians produced it more often (Rottet 1995:129)
      % Racial variation
        % Several features differ along racial lines in Pointe Coupee Creole
          % Whites tend to pronounce rounded front vowels more often, whereas the rounding is more regularly lost among Blacks (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites tend to pronounce word final and preconsonantal rs more regularly. Whites also use the affricate /tʃ/ in place of /k/ more often (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
            % In Breaux Bridge, Neumann (1985) found something of the opposite in that Whites didn't use the affricates /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ in place of /tj/ and /dj/ as these were considered speaking "nègre" (91)
            % Neumann (1985) did however find the Whites in Breaux Bridge were also the ones to pronounce post-vocalic /r/ more often (95)
          % Whites use gender and number agreement for adjectives and determiners much more often (e.g., se zekla vs so zekla-ye and ma manman vs mo manman and mo (f.) movèz vs mo move) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites use determiners that are closer to French and that agree in gender and/or number (e.g. lœrtchèn vwazinaj vs yekèn vwazinaj and tou le paròl-sa-la vs tou paròl-sa-ye) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites tend to use d(e) to indicate a relation between nouns where blacks will just juxtapose the nouns (e.g. enn mezon-d-ekòl vs enn lamezon-ekòl for schoolhouse) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites sometimes pronounce the past tense marker te and the clause final copula ye as ete and e, respectively (Klingler 2003 "Turn":119)
          % Whites tend to use a stem without the final e (or equivalent) in the habitual present and the 2nd person singular imperative, whereas blacks tend to use one long stem invariably in all contexts (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Irregular verbs like to have, to want, and to can take French-like conjugations in the speech of Whites but less in the speech of Blacks (e.g. nou u vs nou te gen and tou me katen ave vs tou mo katen-ye te gen and cochon-la voule vs cochon-la t'ole and ye peu pa parle vs ye pa kapab pale and mo poura chante vs mo sa kapab chante) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":118)
        % Neumann (1985) looked at Blacks in her study of Breaux Bridge Creole because she claimed that their language was «moins affectés par la "décréolisation"» (2)
          % Neumann (1985) reported that towns where Whites spoke Creole were Henderson, Cecilia, Catahoula, and Kraemer (40)
            % These speakers differed in that they did not used post-nominal yé and did have grammatical gender marked in their determiners (Neumann 1985:41)
