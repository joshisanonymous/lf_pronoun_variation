\chapter{Introduction}
  \label{chap:intro}
  The idea of Louisiana in the public imagination is most often rather that of South Louisiana and the New Orleans metropolitan area as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mapacadiana} where the highlighted area is of the traditional French speaking parishes (i.e., counties) of South Louisiana.
  Indeed, the boundary between North and South Louisiana is traditionally a division in culinary practices, religion, and language \parencite[p.~309]{trepanier_french_1988}, where those cultural features that most distinguish Louisiana from the rest of the Deep South are those of South Louisiana.
  The language of North Louisiana, for example, has historically been English rather than French and Creole \parencite[p.~265]{gold_french_1979}, and the most prominent religion has historically been Protestant Christianity rather than Catholicism, to the extent that some have gone so far as to claim that Northerners were ``rabid anti-Catholic Protestants'' \parencite[p.~27]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
  This has led to a situation where South Louisiana locals will even sometimes derisively refer to North Louisiana as ``South Arkansas'', a reference to the perceived indistinguishability of North Louisiana from the rest of the mostly Anglo, Protestant American South.

  For sociolinguists in particular, one major point of interest in South Louisiana is the two major local identity categories: Creole and Cajun.
  As will be discussed in Sections \ref{sec:creole_identity} and \ref{sec:cajun_identity}, the definitions for these two categories each have rather winding histories.
  For \lexi{Creole}, the term has referred to various groups based on country of origin and/or skin color, ending up as a something of a synonym for Black for many people today, though the modern-day use of the term is certainly maintains some variability.
  For \lexi{Cajun}, what started as a term referring to the Acadian diaspora in Louisiana has morphed to refer to people from various backgrounds with the notable restriction that a Cajun and Black identities are mutually exclusive.
  These categories were initially born out of Louisiana's history as a French and Spanish colony before becoming part of the United States, and as such, maintain a regional uniqueness while also coming to be influenced by the racialized social system \parencite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} of the broader US.
  Indeed, the aim of the present study is to better understand if and in what ways Creole and Cajun identities have become racialized \parencite{omi_racial_1986}.
  
  Of more purely linguistic interest, language is a distinguishing feature of South Louisiana in that there is a history of Creoles and Cajuns speaking French and Creole (F\&C)\footnote{
    \lexi{F\&C} will be used as an umbrella term in this study for all French-related language varieties spoken in South Louisiana, as will be discussed further in Section \ref{sec:french_vs_creole}.
  }.
  Today, these languages are spoken in South Louisiana as heritage languages, whereas they were the dominant languages perhaps as recently as the mid 20th century.
  Indeed, by the 1980s, South Louisiana was still being described as ``un exemple par excellence d'une société multilingue''\footnote{
    An ideal example of a multilingual society.
  } \parencite[p.~16]{neumann_creole_1985}.
  F\&C in Louisiana are unique cultural resources that are generally valued by many among the populace and even exploited for commercial gain, but both are on the decline.
  Both languages have been documented as showing variation along geographic and social dimensions, as will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:reg_socio_variation}, though recent work focusing on ethnic and/or racial variation in and around the Lafayette area, the geographic focus of this study, is lacking.
  Furthermore, while sociological and anthropological work on race has begun to inform work in sociolinguistics since \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, there remains ample room in the field for studying racialization.
  Combining this gap in the descriptive literature on F\&C with the need for more analyses of racialization from a sociolinguistic perspective, the objective of this dissertation is thus to examine how Creole and Cajun identities in Louisiana relate to race.
  Chapter \ref{chap:pronoun_variation} will analyse subject pronoun usage to establish whether these function as markers of Creole and Cajun identity.
  Chapter \ref{chap:personal_networks} will look at the personal social networks of participants to understand whether there is segregation, homophily, and along what lines.
  Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:ethnic_race_meaning} will examine how participants spoke about their identities in terms of race and ethnicity.

  \section{Race and ethnicity}
    \label{sec:race_ethnicity}
    As Decker (1994) suggested, when using race in sociological research, it is important to explicitly define \lexi{race} in order to make clear how it is being used \parencite[as cited in][p.~22]{omi_racial_1997}.
    This is especially true in the present study where the goal is to understand if \lexi{Creole} and \lexi{Cajun} are ethnic categories or racialized categories.
    The following is thus not only an explanation of how the concept of race will be used throughout this dissertation but also how it contrasts with ethnicity.

    Early conceptualizations of race and ethnicity in the social sciences were relatively straight forward but often problematic, as well, especially in the case of race.
    Indeed, early attempts at outlining taxonomies of race, such as \citeauthor{blumenbach_natural_1865}'s (\citeyear{blumenbach_natural_1865}), were inherently racist, and unsurprisingly, always placed Whites/Europeans at the top of the hierarchy \parencite[Eze, 1997, as cited in][p.~654]{hesse_racialized_2007}.
    Later definitions did not give race a much better treatment, even when provided by prominent sociologists.
    \textcite{weber_economy_1978}, for instance, defined race as ``common inherited and inheritable traits that actually derive from common descent'' arising when a ``common trait'' is highlighted due to an antagonistic relationship with those having an ``obviously different'' trait (p.~385).
    While this definition incorporates the idea of conflict, which is readily apparent in modern views of race, it remains essentialist in nature.

    On the other hand, early definitions of ethnicity were not particularly problematic for espousing harmful views -- intentionally or not -- but were instead inconsistent.
    For instance, while \textcite{weber_economy_1978} defined ethnic groups as ``groups that entertain subjective belief in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration'' (389), Huxley \& Haddon (1935) used the term as a substitute for race to identify groups at the national level \parencite[as cited in][pp.~481-482]{banton_ethnic_2000}, and a bit later \textcite{gans_symbolic_1979} implicitly defined ethnic groups in terms of immigration, giving Jewish people, Catholics, and Italians as examples in the US.
    Perhaps the most general of these earlier definitions was that proposed by Moerman (1965) first in his work on the Lue in Thailand \parencite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010} and later echoed by others (\foreign{e.g.}, \citeauthor[Giles, 1979, as cited in][]{le_page_acts_1985}, \citeyear[p.~2]{le_page_acts_1985}; \citeauthor{le_page_acts_1985}, \citeyear[p.~2]{le_page_acts_1985}), was that an ethnic group is those individuals who perceive themselves as belonging to the same ethnic category.
    Portions of these definitions of ethnicity are still found in modern definitions, though in the case of Weber's, the involvement of colonization has become central to definitons of race rather than ethnicity.

    These definitions of ethnicity also suggest that there has always been some indecision over whether to treat race and ethnicity as separate analytical concepts or not, and by the 2000s, some had maintained a a distinction between them while others had not or had at least treated it as a blurry distinction \parencite[p.~25]{brubaker_ethnicity_2009}.
    \textcite{loveman_is_1999}, for instance, who proposed abandoning the distinction, argued that the distinction between race and ethnicity is born out of the context of the US and so not generalizable (p.~891), while \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997} argued instead that the distinction is important, stating that  ``[e]thnicity has a primarily sociocultural foundation, and ethnic groups have exhibited tremendous malleability in terms of who belongs,'' whereas races are ``initially ... imposed externally to justify the collective exploitation of a people and are maintained to preserve status differences'' (469).
    He thus later pointed to colonialism as the origin of race and the formation of nation-states as the origin of ethnicity \parencite[pp.902-903]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999}, colonialism naturally not being relegated to the US.
    Indeed, \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017} implicitly agreed when they suggested that studies of race should not be relegated to just the US since European colonialism did not occur exclusively in the US (pp.~634-635).
    It is perhaps because of influential work on race of people like Bonilla-Silva that \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010}, working on ethnicity, revised his earlier view from conceptualizing race and ethnicity as equivalent to treating them as distinct (p.~8).

    For both race and ethnicity, a common thread in their conceptualizations is the idea of contact between groups.
    Indeed, in the case of ethnicity, \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010} argued that a group sees itself as an ethnic group only when there is contact with other such groups and those groups see each other as different despite similarities or differences in their respective cultures (p.~16)
    This is thought of as making such identities salient where they once were not, which is perhaps the reason that the origin of ethnicities lies in the late 18th century with ``European processes of transition from sovereign states into nation-states and to immigration of 'nationals' to foreign lands'' \parencite[A. D. Smith, 1986, as cited in][p.~903]{bonilla-silva_essential_1999}.
    This results in modern definitions such as an ethnic group being any ``named human populations with shared ancestry myths, histories and cultures, having an association with a specific territory and a sense of solidarity'' \parencite[p.~27]{guibernau_ethnic_1997}, the implication being that those histories and ideas of territory become more important to people when they are more at risk of losing them after immigrating.
    This would also be true of similar though more cognitive definitions of ethnicity such as ``a social and cognitive structure that leads people to recognize themselves and/or be recognized by others as having real or putative common ancestry, shared culture, and/or a shared historical past'' \parencite[Brubaker et al., 2004; Cronell \& Hartmann, 1998, as cited in][p.~41]{roth_conceptualizations_2023}.
    What one ends up with is the idea that ethnicity is about belief in a shared history of some sort that is brought to the forefront through contact with others.

    % Modern view of ethnicity (simple)  
      % Various dichotomies in how ethnicity is conceptualized
        % Essentialist vs constructivist, primordialist vs instrumentalist, perennialist vs modernist (Wimmer 2013:1)
      % Primary vs secondary ethnicity
        % Both are based on shared sentiment of belonging together and collective action, but primary is a group that constitutes a sovereign political unit and secondary that constitutes a subdivision within a sovereign political unit (Banton 2000:482)
      % Brubaker (2009) summarized how race had been distinguished from ethnicity along 7 race-to-ethnicity dimensions: 1) involuntary ; voluntary 2) externally assigned; internal self-assigned 3) based on phenotype or nature; based on culture 4) rigid ; flexible 5) hierarchical ; coordinated 6) exclusive ; inclusive 7) a result of colonialism ; a result of nation-state formation (25-26)
        % His position was that neither race nor ethnicity are good analytical concepts in the sense of them representing bounded and solidary groups (Brubaker 2009:27-28) thought he did think ethnicity has a cognitive existence
          % This stance is perhaps supported by the concept of symbolic ethnicity where ethnic identities are no longer about organizing but instead on finding individualized ways to simple feel one's ethnicity (Gans 1979)

    In the case of race, not only is contact involved in modern definitions but also conflict.
    \textcite{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}, for instance, defined a race as a population that is the effect of ``practices of opposition'' between it and another population ``at the economic, political, social, and ideological levels,'' which is ``usually, although not always,'' tied to concepts of the human body \foreign{post hoc} (p.~472).
    Although some still give the body as the primary trait that racial categories are attached to \parencite[\foreign{e.g.}][pp.~6-7]{susberry_racial_2004}, the key aspect of the above definition is that this association is only made after a group has already been labeled as a race to justify actions against said group.
    Groups that have been racialized can be marked by appearance but also by language, religion, or culture, as well \parencite[pp.~636-637]{grosfoguel_racism_2015}.
    Examples of racialized peoples thus include Jewish people in Europe, the Irish in England, and American Indians in the US \parencite[p.~472]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
    This is why \textcite{grosfoguel_race_2004} warned that too much focus on color categories obscures ``other forms of racialization'' (p.~326), and \textcite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, speaking of both race and language, argued that studies of these subjects should not begin with ``racialized bodies and communicative practices'' as this limits one's ability to see how these categories ``become racially and linguistically legible,'' meaning that analyses must start with historical and institutional contexts instead (p.~637).
    
    % Modern view of race
      % Some continue to think of race in terms of bodies
        % "'[A] concept which signifies and symbolizes social conflicts and interests by referring to different types of human bodies'" (Omi & Winant 1994, as cited in Fought 2013:388)
          % Bonilla-Silva (1997) cites Omi and Winant (1986) [just a different edition] as defining race as the outcome of the process of "'the extension of racial meaning to a previously racially unclassified relationship, social practice or group'" (471), which isn't focusing so heavily on bodies.
        % Both of these definitions place conflict at the center of race
      % Definition
        % This can be based on physical attributes
          % Light-skinned Europeans arrived in the US being classified as "not-yet White" only to become "White" but "ethnic" still after a short time (Roediger 1994, as cited in Bonilla-Silva 1997:472)

    The historical context for race is colonialism.
    As \textcite{hesse_racialized_2007} argued, race is not about bodies but rather about Europeanness vs non-Europeanness (p.~646), which led him to propose the idea of racialized modernity as he viewed modernity as going hand in hand with the development of the concept of Europe versus non-Europe that became symbolized as race.
    Likewise, the naturalization of languages with races was also part of this \parencite[p.~623]{rosa_unsettling_2017}.
    While Hesse's focus was more generally on modernity, colonialism was a major component of this process as it brought about the possibility of enrichment through the exploitation of Others.
    Indeed, \textcite{grosfoguel_race_2004} similarly stated that Europeans and non-Europeans were the two groups involved in the ``global racial/ethnic hierarchy'' and that this hierarchy stems from the capitalist world economy (p.~320).

    Without the presence of resources that one population wishes to monopolize, as with colonialism, there is little in the way of motivation for any form of rational racism.
    This is why \textcite{ray_theory_2019} defined race as ``a relationship between persons'' constructed through ``the distribution of social, psychological, and material resources'' (p.~29).
    It is through the desire to control the distribution of resources that racial schema are activated and then attached to those resources \parencite[p.~32]{ray_theory_2019}.
    For example, only because access to education exists is the access to that education partitioned along racialized lines in order to help one population maintain its privileged position with respect to this resource.
    Once racialized, race becomes a form of capital where the dominant, unmarked population wields more power.
    In the case of the US then, Whiteness has been described as a form of property ``encompassing `all of a person's legal rights''' \parencite[Harris, 1995, as cited in][p.~30]{ray_theory_2019}.
        % Importantly, this was born with colonialism or colonial-like activities
          % Lenin (1916) had also suggested that colonialism existed as least as far back as Rome, which he argued was built on slavery (as cited in Wolpe 1975:113), (probably accidentally) making the connection between colonialism and race
          % Casanova (1965) argued that "[r]acism and racial discrimination are the historical legacy of the conquest of some peoples by others, from antiquity to the expansion of the great empires and colonial systems of the modern era" (31)
            % This presages later work on racial formation but also characterizes colonialism as more than just the European activities since the 15th century
      % Racial formation
        % Racial formation is "'the sociohistorical process by which racial categories are created, inhabited, transformed, and destroyed'" (Omi & Winant 1986, as cited in Bonilla-Silva 1997:466)
        % Quijano (1993) claimed that the concept of race was born with the formation of the Americas (as cited in Grosfoguel 2004:326)
        % The concept of race was created during the European colonial period (Stoler 1995, as cited in Rosa & Flores 1997:623)
        % "[R]acial social orders" emerged "after the imperialist expansion of Europe to the New World and Africa" (Boggs 1970; Cox 1948; Furnivall 1948; Bagubane 1990; E. Williams 1944/1961; R. Williams 1990, all as cited in Bonilla-Silva 1997:473)
        % What colonialism does is allow for such an extreme othering of groups of people that they are conceptualized in society as human but less human than the colonizers, hence a separate race, complete with essentialist beliefs about said race
          % Essentialist views have generally been found to be associated with racist views (Roth et al. 2023:45)
          % Essentialist beliefs about races have persisted right up to the present, long after direct colonialism has ended (e.g., Roth et al. 2019, as cited in Roth et al. 2023:45; Hoffman et al. 2016:4297)
          % Essentialist views even persist among researchers in genetics, biology, and anthropology (Roth et al. 2023)
          % Gans (1979) had discussed how 1st and 2nd generation ethnic groups in the US lived in ethnic neighborhoods (i.e., colonies?) where their status as members of the ethnic group were imposed on them from outside (8)
            % This is not entirely different from how race is theorized today, meaning some groups described as ethnic in the past (e.g., Jews, Catholics, Italians, etc. in this case) are better understood as races in modern frameworks
        % Even if a racial category is created by an outside group, once created, it still "becomes a real category of group association and identity" (Bonilla-Silva 1997:471-472)
      % Racialized social systems
        % Up through the 1990s, R. Benedict's (1945) definition of racism as "the dogma that one ethnic group is condemned by nature to congenital inferiority and another group is destined to congenital superiority" had been the norm that was used in research (Bonilla-Silva 1997:465)
          % Ethnocentrism already existed earlier, and is similar, but doesn't require a sense of superiority (Bonilla-Silva 1997:465)
          % This sort of ideological racism is conceptualized as irrational (Bonilla-Silva 1997:468)
          % The racialized social systems framework shifts racism from a irrational personal ideology to a rational structure that creates lower life chances for the oppressed race (Bonilla-Silva 1997:470)
        % This framework has recently been extended to the level of organizations, which has been argued to not simply be a reflection of an underlying racialized social system (Ray 2019)
          % Ray (2019) stated that neighborhoods can be a sort of meso-level organization to which his framework is applicable (28)
            % This can probably be left out since, even though I'm looking at neighborhoods in a way, what my participants tend to mention is a lot of segregation, which is also what my SNA suggests, whereas to have racialized neighborhoods, groups must be in contact and have different experiences
    % How to distinguish
      % Colonialism (starts in)
        % Features of colonialism
          % A colony itself has been defined as "a territory occupied by emigrants from a 'mother' country" who exercise dominance "over indigenous populations" in "economic, ... military, political, and spiritual" terms (Casanova 1965:28-30)
          % 1) A lack of communication within and between colonies 2) Dependency on the colonizing state due to reliance on a single economic resource 3) It's a source of cheap labor with no access to meaningful ownership of resources 4) Standards of life are subsistence level 5) Violent repression is used to quell conflicts 6) The colonial system increases inequality, esp. racial (Casanova 1965:30-31)
          % 1) Compulsory entry of the colonized into the dominant society 2) Transformation and destruction of the colonized's culture by colonizers 3) Management and manipulation of the colonized by colonizers 4) Racism against the colonized 5) Division of occupations between the colonized and colonizers (Blauner 1972, as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:246)
        % Internal colonialism
          % The idea that a version of colonialism has continued even where direct, explicit colonialism has ended has been around for a while
            % Cruse (1962) compared African-Americans to colonized people (as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:239)
            % The Black Power movement in the late 1960s embraced the idea (Pinderhughes 2011:240)
            % R. Allen (1969) incorporated social class within the colonized group (as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:249)
          % Definitions
            % the domination and exploitation of one class of natives by another class of natives in a society after the experience of the domination and exploitation of natives by foreigners (Casanova 1965:27)
            % "a geographically-based pattern of subordination of a differentiated population, located within the dominant power or country," that is "expressed in the policies and practices of a variety of societal institutions ... within a former settler colony or settler colony system" (Pinderhughes 2011:236)
          % Criteria for internal colonialism
            % Du Bois (1895) outlined 12 shared experiences between colonized and semi-colonized people (Rabaka 2007, as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:238)
              % 1) Physical and/or psychological violence 2) Economic exploitation 3) Poverty 4) Illiteracy 5) Lawlessness, stealing, and crime 6) Starvation 7) Death 8) Disaster 9) Disease 10) Disenfranchisement 11) Denial of cultural equality 12) Denial of participation in the political process
              % This would perhaps encompass far too many types of conflicts
            % A group (e.g., Black Americans) must be conceived of as a nation within a nation (Pinderhughes 2011:237)
              % Pinderhughes's (2011) proposed idea of a geo-focused internal colonialism theory, as applied to African-Americans, took a more fine-grained approach by dividing this up into many colonies (251)
            % Does it even need to include previously colonized people?
              % Grosfoguel (2004), in discussing immigration, described "colonial immigrant" groups who are lumped in with existing "colonial/racial subjects" as "racialized ethnicities" (323)
              % In early formulations, it did have to involve previously colonized people
                % Casanova (1965) stated that what makes INTERNAL colonialism stand apart is that it involves "an encounter between two races, cultures, or civilizations, whose genesis and evolution occurred without any mutual contact up to one specific moment," which sets it apart from similar situations such as class conflicts or rural-urban conflicts and is also what "makes possible intensive racial and cultural discriminations" (33)
      % Colonial conflict (looks like)
        % It can be difficult to identify specific types of conflict
          % Bonilla-Silva (1997) acknowledged that both racial and ethnic conflicts exist, citing conflicts in Rwanda and the Balkans as examples of the latter (469) as well as class conflicts (471)
            % By the beginning of the 21st century, it was being argued that ethnicity had been growing in importance in social and political landscapes given state-internal ethnic conflicts, ethnic migration leading to conflicts, concerns over the erasure of ethnic identities through globalization which in some cases have led to nationalist political movements, etc. (Eriksen 1993/2010:2-3)
            % Bonilla-Silva (1997) argued that class conflicts take precedence over racial conflicts when "economic, political, and social distance between races decreases substantially" (471)
              % The same could perhaps be said about class conflicts over ethnic conflicts
          % The difficulty with ethnic conflict
            % Banton (2000) discussed these difficulties for defining conflicts as ethnic
              % Describing a conflict as ethnic implies that the conflict has a distinctive ethnic quality and is best understood by looking at how the conflict is powered by ethnicity (Banton 2000:483)
              % He noted that interethnic relationships are often multidimensional (Banton 2000)
                % The Troubles appeared to be Catholic vs Protestant, but this difference isn't what caused the conflict in the first place (Banton 2000:485)
              % To mobilise ethnic collective action
                % Multidimensionality is one of the things that needs to be changed towards unidimensionality (Banton 2000)
                % Exit options also need to be removed (Banton 2000:494)
            % Ethnic conflicts must not be about control of the state as this is when ethnicity crosses over into nationality
              % Nationality "holds that political boundaries should be coterminous with cultural boundaries" (Gellner 1983), whereas the concepts of ethnicity and nationality are essentially otherwise the same, both delineating groups according to cultural similarity (Eriksen 1993/2010:10)
              % Nations are politically oriented (B. Anderson 1983/2006:6-7)
          % The difficulty with internal colonial conflict
            % Wolpe (1975) pointed out the need to explain the difference between class exploitation and domination versus the racial/ethnic/cultural/national exploitation and domination of internal colonialism (108)
            % Wolpe's (1975) discussion implies that the sort of conflict in internal colonialism is specifically about exploitation and domination
              % Exploitation has been defined in terms of labor as the expropriation of the surplus labor of one social class by another social class (Bettelheim 1972, as cited in Wolpe 1975:110)
                % Wolpe (1975) gave plunder, exchange of non-equivalents, and price formation as possible means of exploitation in a direct colonisation scenario (112)
    
    \subsection{Bi- and multi-racial identities}
      % The terms mixed race and multiracial imply the existence of pure, discrete races, as well (Omi 1997:19)

      In order to give a full account of the racial identities of Louisianians, the theoretical treatment of bi- and multi-racial identities is also of great importance.
      As in many other places, race in Louisiana is complicated by a history of children born of interracial relations, especially when it comes to the history of Creole identity as will be discussed in section \ref{sec:creole_identity}.
      Said children may take on a bi- or multi-racial identity, which can be defined in various ways, such as ``someone whose parents are of two socially and phenotypically distinct racial backgrounds'' \parencite[Root, 1992, as cited in][p.~16]{susberry_racial_2004}.
      This definition uses ``parents'' as a buffer between the person in question and their ancestors, as there is likely a socially defined limit to what people will consider in terms of what counts as someone's ``racial background.''
      For example, though treating race as a biological fact rather than a social construct linked to biological beliefs is not valid, it has nevertheless been found that many African-Americans have some European ancestry \parencite[p.~42]{bryc_genetic_2015}, but that does not mean that African-Americans by and large identify as biracial especially in light of the history of the one-drop rule in the United States\footnote{
        This is not to say that the one drop rule has been exclusively used in the United States.
      } which formalized the idea that having any African ancestry at all made one simply Black, an idea which still impacts racial identities today \parencite{khanna_if_2010}.
      Likewise, some of my own participants in this study discussed how common mixed racial ancestries are among both Creoles and Cajuns, usually in terms of introducing American Indians into the picture, but how this is also not something people want to readily acknowledge about their backgrounds.
      Of course, American Indians themselves constitute a group that has conceptualized in US society as a single race despite having a wide range of phenotypical features \parencite[p.~472]{bonilla-silva_rethinking_1997}.
      American Indians are also not all from a single tribe, so even ethnically -- if one is to have cultural history as part of one's definition of ethnicity -- they do not form a monolithic group.
      Indeed, in Louisiana alone, there are 4 extant federally recognized tribes \parencite{indian_affairs_bureau_indian_2021}, which itself is a gross reduction in the number of distinct unrecognized tribes and past tribes that have resided in the territory of the state.
      The potential for a large number of people to claim bi- or multi-racial identities is thus quite high in the United States.

      A potential does not mean that many people do in fact claim such identities, however, and in all likelihood, those who do claim bi- and multi-racial identities are likely underdocumented in the United States.
      % Socially, the point of the one drop rule was to force Black-White biracial Americans into singular Black identities, leading to them face the same problems that Black Americans faced, that is to say enslavement and later continued discrimination \parencite[Khanna, 2011, as cited in][pp.~17-18]{holliday_intonational_2016}.
      On a formal level, it was not until 2000 that one could indicate more than one race on the US Census \parencite[as cited in][p.~2]{susberry_racial_2004}, which at the time resulted in 2.4\% of the population choosing more than one race and another 5.5\% choosing ``Other'' \parencite[Singer, 2002, as cited in][p.~2]{susberry_racial_2004}.
      This sort of erasure of identities is not just of concern for the rights and well-being of those who do not fit neatly into established racial categories but can also impact research that implicates race.
      % Some Arab Americans have argued that they aren't represent because US Directive 15 classifies them as White instead of Middle Eastern (Omi 1997:12-13)
      % Some native Hawaiians wished to be identified in US Directive 15 as "American Indian or Alaskan Native" rather than "Asian and Pacific Islander" because their "history and current sovereignty" claims made them more similar to the former (Omi 1997:12)
        % Similarly, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and others in the US have used the panethnic term South Asian (Omi 1997:23)
      % The category of Asian American came about because, after the Civil Rights era, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and Korean Americans began using the term to assert their shared experiences of discrimination (Omi 1997:17)
      In the field of sociolinguistics, for instance, it has been pointed out that researchers often rely on census data due to ease of access, but the inflexibility of census options means that many people can be misrepresented or unrepresented in the resulting studies \parencite[p.~2]{holliday_multiracial_2019}.
      % Similarly, while accounting for varied racial identities is important in research for both ethical and validity reasons, as \textcite{holliday_intonational_2016} pointed out, it is also important to not essentialize bi-/multi-racial as being somehow special or abnormal in comparison to monoracial individuals (pp.~24-27).
      Indeed, as anthropological and sociological work has progressed since the introduction of the theory of intersectionality \parencite{crenshaw_demarginalizing_2015}, it has become clear that few if any social identities can be fit neatly into discrete boxes, which is all the more reason to take a closer look in this study at how race and ethnicity interact.

    \subsection{In the United States}
      \label{sec:united_states}
      % Pinderhughes (2011), adapting from Marable (2002), argued that colonized African America had passed through four "racial domains": 1) Slavery (introduction up to Civil War) 2) Jim Crow (Emancipation up to 100 years after) 3) Colonial Ghetto (1910 to 1970) 4) Neo-Colonial Ghetto (more recent?)
      % At the peak for Black banks in 1926, they held 0.2% of all assets in the US (Baradaran 2017, as cited in Ray 2019:38)
      % Pre-Civil War
      % Reconstruction
        % R. Allen (1969) argued that post-Civil War America had three social classes related to Blacks: 1) working class Blacks who were below 2) the Black bourgeoisie who were below 3) Whites (as cited in Pinderhughes 2011:249)
          % He described the Black bourgeoisie as facing pressure to exert control over other Blacks
          % This perhaps a common feature in racialized social systems, as a similar middle status group referred to as morenos or pardos developed in Brazil (Wade 1997, as cited in Bonilla-Silva 1999:901), as well as with early Creoles in the Americas (Anderson 1983/2006:59-60)
        % Du Bois argued for full inclusion into society whereas Washington argued for industrial education for menial work (Morris 2015, as cited in Ray 2019:39)
      % Jim Crow
        % The Communist Party USA in the 1920s, focusing on the Black Belt of the South, were the first to call "for self-determination of the Negro nation" in the US (Pinderhughes 2011:242)
        % Southern legislators put Jim Crow supporters on the boards of HBCUs out of fears that providing Blacks with good educations would produce a class that can challenge White political hegemony (Williamson 2004, as cited in Ray 2019:39)
        % The colonial administration in the US was argued to have collapsed with the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, though this did not mark the end of the "colonial situation" (Grosfoguel 2004:325-326)
      % More recent
        % Unmarked Whiteness
          % Waters (1990) reported that her White participants saw their ethnicities as "flexible, symbolic and voluntary" (as cited in Omi 1997:19)
            % On the other hand, Omi (1997) argued that Whites in the US were going through their own form of racialization as "[w]hat was previously a transparent and 'natural' category has now been rendered problematic as Whites experience a profound racialization" (20)
              % He went on to describe how Whites question their own identity when coming to recognize identities of others
          % For US Directive 15, Blacks are linked to "'black racial groups of Africa'" whereas no such reference is made for defining Whites as linked to Europe or North Africa or wherever (Omi 1997:11)
          % Although not discussed as White organizations, groups such as evangelicals (Bracey 2016) and the NRA are White (Zakrison et al. 2017) (Ray 2019:46)
        % For Blacks and Whites with criminal records in NYC, the former had more difficulty obtaining employment than the latter (Pager 2007; Pager et al. 2009, as cited in Ray 2019:41)
        % The Census Bureau concluded that 40% of Hispanics in the US answered incorrectly for their race and ethnicity in 1980 and 1990 because they didn't choose both an ethnicity and a race (Omi 1997:14)

      While the specific racial and ethnic milieu that will be analyzed here is situated in mostly rural South Louisiana, it would still be difficult to interpret these categories without considering their place in the broader context of the country as a whole.
      Despite this area being historically considered isolated from the United States, the undoing of that isolation over time has in fact been a factor in not only the decline of F\&C in the state but also the reinterpreted of racial and ethnic identities, as will be discussed in subsequent sections.
      In looking at race and ethnicity in the United States then, one finds growing diversity but persistent inequality and indications of new forms of intolerance.

      % In section \ref{sec:race_ethnicity}, it was stated that the assumed definition for race in this study strongly implicates phenotypes, and while I do not wish to immediately backtrack from that definition, it must be acknowledged that racial labeling in the United States is not always so focused on appearance.
      % For example, it has been pointed out that lighter skinned Black people exist who are still considered Black on account of factors such as ancestry and culture \parencite[p.~1]{susberry_racial_2004}.
      % Indeed, bi- and multi-racial individuals may not fit physical prototypical molds for the neat, discrete racial categories into which they are sometimes placed as a result of their racially diverse backgrounds.
      % Americans may not be consciously considering culture when asked racially to categorize individuals, but perhaps this consideration will become more conscious as the US becomes more and more diverse.

      Census records for the United States suggest that diversity has in fact increased despite the aforementioned erasure of some racial identities.
      In terms of race, the records suggest that the US has gone from 1 in 8 people being non-White to 1 in 4.
      Depending on how one categorizes Latinxs, when treated as non-White, the ratio becomes 1 in 3 \parencite[pp.~25-26]{fischer_century_2006}.
      This pattern holds through the 2020 except for non-Whites increasing to 42\% of the population when treating Latinxs as non-White.
      Latinx has indeed become the largest non-White group at 19.5\% of the population, followed by Blacks at 13.7\% \parencite{noauthor_us_2020}.
      On the neighborhood level, census records suggested that the proportion of White-dominated neighborhoods in the country decreased from 66.0\% to 42.5\% between 1990 and 2010, which may be driven by immigrants mostly settling in highly populous metropolitan areas \parencite[pp.~175-176]{wright_patterns_2014}.
      All of these increases in diversity have also been apparent to White Americans.
      Already by 2000, ``roughly half'' of White Americans thought they were part of a minority group \parencite[Alba et al., 2005, as cited in][p.~437]{smith_social_2014}, which may explain in part a pause in improvements in ethnic and racial tolerance and equality.
      % Ethnic and racial diversity, measured with Shannon entropy using census records, has increased between 1990 and 2010 (0.4576 > 0.6015) (Wright et al. 2014:175)
      % Growth in the Latinx population in 2011 was driven more by births than by immigration (Pew Hispanic Center 2011, as cited in Wright et al. 2014:181)

      Though in general the US has has experienced improved relations in terms of tolerance of racial and ethnic minorities between the 1970s and the 2010s \parencite[Bobo et al., 2012; Firebaugh \& Davis, 1988, both as cited in][p.~437]{smith_social_2014}, there are still signs of persistent problems.
      Racial income inequality had been decreasing earlier in the 20th century but stalled by 2000 \parencite[Leicht, 2008, as cited in][p.~436]{smith_social_2014}, and as an example of what this looks like on local levels, \citeauthor{van_hofwegen_coming_2010}'s (\citeyear{van_hofwegen_coming_2010}) reported that 71\% of the African-American youths lived in below the poverty line during the years 1990 to 2006 in their longitudinal study in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (p.~431).
      Increased tolerance has also dovetailed into exploitation for profit through phenomena such as linguistic minstrelsy \parencite{bucholtz_performing_2011, eberhardt_first_2015}.
      These continued issues tend to focus on African-Americans for obvious reasons: the history of slavery in the US and its reverberations are going to be felt most clearly by the group whose ancestors were the primary group that was enslaved.
      As will be seen in Section \ref{sec:racial_ethnic_variation}, race and ethnicity in sociolinguistics has also been mostly centered on African-Americans when studies are based in the US.
      % White teenagers in general perform AAL \parencite[C. Cutler 2002, as cited in][]{cutler_hip-hop_2007}

    \subsection{In sociolinguistics}
      \label{sec:racial_ethnic_variation}
      % Rosa & Flores (2017) proposed a "raciolinguistic perspective" for approaching the study of race and language
      % The naturalization of race and of languages associated with races are the "[t]wo central components of the European colonial formation of modernity" (Rosa & Flores 2017:623)
        % Hierarchically then, non-European languages were also placed below European languages (Makoni & Pennycook 2007; Veronelli 2015, as cited in Rosa & Flores 2017:623)
        % They called this linking of language and racial identity raciolinguistic enregisterment (Rosa & Flores 2017:631) after Agha's enregisterment (2003)
        % Racialized Others are unable to overcome this naturalization even when they learn the language of their oppressors which is still perceived as linguistically lacking (Rosa & Flores 2017:625, citing others)
          % This has important implications as language skills can be seen as a commodity (Rosa & Flores 2017:638, citing Heller & Duchêne 2012 as giving examples)
        % Bonfiglio (2002, 2010) argued that categories such as "Standard American English" and "native speaker" should be understood as representing racialized perceptions where anything associated with the dominant group is unmarked and anything associated with the dominated racialized group is inherently deficient (as cited in Rosa & Flores 2017:632)
      % Rosa & Flores (2017) proposed that perceptual work on race should refuse to analyze the production of racialized people and instead look at how listeners employ their race and language ideologies in interpreting racialized people (628-629)
        % This approach has not really been taken up for the obvious reason that knowing what racialized people are objectively producing is a necessary step in interpreting how a listeners ideologies are shaping what they are hearing
      % A natural response to the issues this framework raises is to propose affirming the language of racialized populations and providing them access to the tools needed to learn dominant ways of speaking, but this solution ignores the problems inherent in the racialized social system itself and puts the burden on racialized people to do more than others need to do (Rosa & Flores 2017:639)

      Race and ethnicity have been analyzed in sociolinguistics and language variation studies as far back as the foundational works in the field.
      \textcite{labov_social_2006} considered Italians and Jewish people and \textcite{labov_social_2006, labov_contraction_1969, labov_sociolinguistic_1972} African-Americans in New York City while \textcite{wolfram_sociolinguistic_1969} looked at African-Americans in Detroit, for instance.
      The field progressed in its treatment of race and ethnicity in much the same way as the field in general did, from the macrosociological level to the ethnographic and local level to social meaning-oriented work \parencite{eckert_three_2012}, but race and ethnicity in language has had its own indiosyncracies in how it has been approached over time.
      Save for few exceptions, such as \textcite{bucholtz_white_2010} who argued that ``race is ideologically grounded ... in biological differences'' and ethnicity in ``cultural differences'' (pp.~5-6), the distinction between race and ethnicity is little mentioned in sociolinguistics, which is relevant to this study in that it aims to fill that gap by offering a more intersectional analysis of these two social categories.

      Much of the research that came out of the first wave of sociolinguistics was aimed at showing that the languages used by minority groups were indeed logical and rule-bound.
      This does not mean that they did not touch on connections to social issues, but social issues were not yet the focus of this work.
      For instance, \textcite{labov_social_2006} analyzed Italians, Jewish people, and African-Americans because these were ``the three \emph{ethnic groups} large enough to be studied in the sample'' [italics mine] (p.~180), and found that Italians, Jewish people, and African-Americans in New York City all had their own vowel usage patterns in English.
      For the first point, it is noteworthy that the term \lexi{ethnicity} signifies both ethnicity and race here and that the first two groups were likely racialized as White but not analyzed as a single White group.
      This inadvertantly highlights the defaultness of White identities where it is common to only explicitly consider them if they can be ethnicized.
      For the second point, for some of the ongoing vowel changes in New York City, it was noted that African-American usage ``follows an entirely different pattern'' \parencite[p.~247]{labov_social_2006}, which could most likely be interpreted as an expression of the segregation between Black and White Americans.
      Although this was not a point Labov seemed to be attempting to make, it was nonetheless an important one.

      While first wave studies of language variation went a long way towards reducing the stigma attached to minority varieties, some of the framing was still problematic.
      One of those framings is the regular use of the qualifier \lexi{non-standard} for varieties spoken mostly by minority groups \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][p.~715]{labov_contraction_1969}, but perhaps the most significant framing issue was the idea that African-American Language (AAL) was a single monolithic variety, which may have simply been the good intention of wanting to demonstrate the logical structure of AAL being taken too far.
      Fieldwork on AAL from locations as varied as Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Los Angeles were all described as essentially the same language variety with only a few minor variations \parencite[p.~715]{labov_contraction_1969}.
      Even by the 1990s, well into the second wave of sociolinguistics, African-American speech was still being described, for example, as ``the uniform grammar used by African Americans who have minimal contact with other dialects typically in contexts where only speakers of that vernacular are present'' \parencite[Labov, 1998, as cited in][p.~165]{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010} or as a continuum, called African-American English in this case, ranging from essentially the privileged varieties in American English to African-American Vernacular English \parencite[Rickford, 1999, as cited in][p.~165]{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010}.
      Such aggregating of the speech of disparate groups of people risks being a source of erasure not only of distinct ways of speaking but of the distinct identities that are attached to those ways of speaking.

      The second wave of sociolinguistics was said to have begun with \textcite{milroy_language_1987} \parencite[p.~91]{eckert_three_2012}.
      The attention that AAL received during the first wave diminished after this time, and what work was being done in that area involved more fine-grained analyses.
      For example, \textcite{rickford_addressee-_1994} examined constraints on style shifting relative to the race of an African-American woman's interlocutors.
      In zooming in to more local contexts, more local social categories also became the focus, which often meant ethnic categories rather than racial.
      In one case tangentially related to the current study, the verbal morphology of ``Cajun Vernacular English'' was analyzed not only on its own but in relation to White southern varities as well as AAL, suggesting a complex relationship between Cajuns these other groups \parencite{dubois_verbal_2003}.
      This work also exemplified an explicit effort to re-evaluate treatments of the concept of ethnicity at the time as the authors noted the difficulties they had in deciding whether to label Cajun Vernacular English as an ethnolect or not \parencite[p.~56]{dubois_verbal_2003}, though notably that discussion was backgrounded to endnotes.
      What was not being re-evaluated, however, was the defaultness of White identities.
      Indeed, \textcite{dubois_verbal_2003} did not attempt to define Cajun identity but instead implied that it was the identity of Whites in South Louisiana.

      In a similar fashion, \textcite{horvath_delimiting_1987}, though not working on language in the US, explicitly discussed the utility of ethnicity as a social variable.
      They argued that ethnicity is not well defined because it might have varying degrees of influence depending on which immigration generation one is in and between the same immigration generations in different communities \parencite[p.~183]{horvath_delimiting_1987}.
      In the latter point, they were avoiding the trappings that earlier researchers fell into when establishing AAL as a monolith.
      They were also making immigration the central factor in ethnic group formation, similar to what \textcite{labov_social_2006} had implicitly done by singling out Italians in New York City.
      That is not to say that immigration has no role in the formation of ethnic groups, but it is not a necessary condition unless one is conceptualizing \lexi{immigration} as any relocation of a group of people, even when not crossing state boundaries.
      Indeed, both \textcite{weber_economy_1978} and \textcite{eriksen_ethnicity_2010}, discussed in Section \ref{sec:race_ethnicity}, highlighted contact as a necessary condition for group identities to form, as does the concept of enregisterment from the third wave of sociolinguistics for named language varieties \parencite{agha_social_2003, johnstone_mobility_2006}.
      The point here being that, by the end of the second wave, researchers had begun to be more cognizant of the need to reconsider how social variables are used and understood, and that included ethnicity.
      % By the end of the second wave, Rickford in particular was trying to encourage socioliguists to use their positions and knowledge (that they've by and large gained via the good will of minority groups) to give back to minority communities (e.g., Rickford 1997 "Unequal")

      The third wave of sociolinguistics turned the focus of research towards social meaning, so it perhaps not surprising that race and ethnicity have been examined more carefully during this phase, which includes attempts to correct early framings of AAL that treated it as a monolith.
      Indeed, the data needed to conclude that AAL is not a monolith had been present and available for some time already but was not interpreted as suggesting that there was variation between groups of AAL speakers.
      As \textcite{jones_toward_2015} pointed out, for example, \textcite{labov_language_1972} found non-rhoticity among some speakers in New York City but \textcite{riney_linguistic_1990} found full rhoticity Waterloo, Iowa (p.~404).
      Likewise, \textcite{rickford_addressee-_1994} reported that Foxy Brown, an individual African-American woman from the California Bay Area, exceeded the cumulative total use of invariant habitual \lexi{be} by all of the speakers analyzed in New York City \parencite{labov_study_1968}, Detroit \parencite{wolfram_sociolinguistic_1969}, and Brazos Valley, Texas \parencite{bailey_decreolization_1987} (p.~254), although no acknowledgement was made that this may be an indication of these simply being different varieties of AAL.
      
      By the 2010s, in contrast, findings on AAL were being argued as suggesting that there is regional variation despite the existence of ``supra-regional'' features that are shared in all regions that are not part of European American speech \parencite[p.~232]{wolfram_american_2016}, and work had begun on mapping out these regional variations \parencite{jones_toward_2015}.
      This is a clear improvement in undoing the previous erasure of African-American identities but does not mean that framing and methodological issues have all been resolved.
      \textcite{jones_toward_2015}, in particular, used Twitter to map out AAL, which obscures the identities of those making posts.
      He framed this problem as a need to determine if a poster is Black or not, which already presumes that only those who are Black use AAL, and then proceeded to address this problem by claiming to have developed ``an intuitive feel'' and using hip-hop language as a ``touchstone''\footnote{
        In fairness, he also wrote that ``hip hop is emphatically not the same as AAVE.''
      } despite the trope of believing that hip-hop language is equivalent to AAL \parencite[pp.~411-412]{jones_toward_2015}.
      While Jones is not representative of the practices of the field as a whole, this is indicative of the need to be vigilant about framing and methodology that can be damaging to minority communities as it can always creep back into the field in new forms.

      More relevant to the current study is that third wave studies have continued to conflate the concepts of race and ethnicity.
      For instance, \citeauthor{wolfram_american_2016}'s (\citeyear{wolfram_american_2016}) review, just mentioned, started out by stating, ``African American English (AAE) is the paradigmatic case of ethnicity-based language diversity'' (p.~217), characterizing AAL as being relating to an ethnic group rather than a racial group.
      \textcite{becker_linguistic_2014}, as another example, framed her study of AAL as a study of an ethnolect in stating, ``African American English (AAE) is the quintessential ethnolect in North American sociolinguistics'' (p.~44).
      In Becker's case, this appears to be a result of treating \lexi{African-American} as a Black ethnicity, acknowledged by a statement defining ``black New Yorkers'' as ``a salient racial category that includes African Americans as well as Caribbeans'' (p.~46).
      However, in the case of \textcite{wolfram_american_2016}, through statements such as ``contact between whites and blacks over the generations may have resulted in speakers of both ethnicities picking up features of one another'' (p.~225), make it clear that they are treating race and ethnicity as one and the same.
      This latter approach, where race and ethnicity are synonyms and, relatedly, Black and African-American are often synonyms, is common in sociolinguistics, leaving open questions about how these types of social identities interact when treated separately.

      \citeauthor{wolfram_american_2016}'s (\citeyear{wolfram_american_2016}) statement also raises the question of crossing racial and ethnic boundaries, which has also been a focal point for third wave sociolinguistics that is relevant to behavior that will be seen among participants of the current study.
      This phenomenon had more or less been coined near the end of the second wave of sociolinguistics as \lexi{crossing}, a general term that refers to when a speakers switches to any language code that is not considered to belong to them regardless of what class of people own said language code, so to speak \parencite{rampton_crossing:_1995}.
      However, crossing refers to a sort of momentary code-switching rather than one's primary language being that which does not typically align with their social identity, both of which have been dealt with in the literature, often, though not always, in terms of the use of AAL.

      Given the glottonym AAL, the presumed owning group for this variety is African-Americans, though as C. Cutler (2002) put it, White people ``can and do pass for native speakers of AAE'' \parencite[as cited in][p.~529]{cutler_hip-hop_2007}.
      How such boundary crossing is characterized can depend on the direction in which it is occurring.
      It has been argued that in studies of African-Americans using linguistic features indexing White identities, researchers conceptualize this as assimilation, but in studies of White people using African-American features \parencite[\foreign{e.g.},][]{bucholtz_you_1999}, researchers conceptualize this as indexing African-American qualities that these speakers admire \parencite[p.~27]{eckert_where_2008}.
      Such framing helps to reify the position of Whites at the top of the social hierarchy.
      As \textcite{bucholtz_white_2010} poignantly -- and perhaps ironically -- stated in her analysis of White youths constructing their identities through the use of AAL features, ``The hegemony of whiteness is typically exerted not by calling attention to white racial dominance but instead by treating whiteness as unremarkable -- even unnoticeable'' (p.~15).

      Not all boundary crossing studies have looked at White people using AAL features nor even implicated AAL at all.
      In Philadelphia, Asian American youths were seen using AAL features to varying degrees to thread the delicate needle of finding their place in the racial system of the United States \parencite{reyes_appropriation_2005}.
      In the South Carolina Sea Island, a pair of speakers, one White and one Black, were both documented using English-based creole phonological features, but only the Black speaker used creole morphosyntactic features \parencite[Rickford, 1985, as cited in][pp.~390-391]{fought_ethnicity_2013}.
      In California, both White and Latinx students were reported using exploiting a phonological variable, but within the Latinx group, this variable also indexed their place in the social order of the school \parencite{eckert_where_2008}.
      These sort of cases of drawing from language varieties associated of other groups in different ways and to different degrees led \textcite{benor_ethnolinguistic_2010} to codify this in her ethnolinguistic repertoire framework, describing an ethnolinguistic repertoire as ``a fluid set of linguistic resources that member sof an ethnic group may use variably as they index their ethnic identities'' (p.~160), though she also made clear that the framework could be used for non-ethnic identities, as well.

      What this discussion of crossing racial and ethnic boundaries often exemplifies is approaches to constructing racial and ethnic identities, constructing racial and ethnic identities through language is also influenced by other social factors.
      National identity was seen as an important factor in the identity construction of Latinas in California \parencite{mendoza-denton_homegirls:_2008}, while socioeconomic class was seen to create problems for African-American identity construction in terms of having to navigate maintaining one's identitly while facing pressure to change for greater economic opportunities \parencite{rahman_middle-class_2008}.
      Even being bilingual can be a source of tension relevant to racial and ethnic identity construction.
      \textcite{rosa_looking_2019} argued that language and race ideologies delegitimize the use of both languages that bilinguals possess in that they are treated as imperfect speakers of both (pp.~126-127).
      This study was not focused on identity construction, but just as African-Americans feel pressure to use a higher privileged language variety, racialized bilinguals may feel a sense of insecurity that impacts their decisions on which of their languages to use and what form those languages must take.
      % In New York, Asian and non-Asian speakers differed in their realizations of /ɛ/ and breathiness with Asian men producing more fronted variants and breathier speech (Newman & Wu 2011:166/168)
      % A Lumbee Indian being interviewed by a African-American Cherokee showed how ethnic identity can be linguistically negotiated in real time as the speakers' speech was most different when discussing race and most similar while discussing friends and family (Schilling-Estes 2004)
      % Rosa (2019) argued that language and race ideologies delegitimize the use of both languages that bilinguals possess in that they are treated as imperfect speakers of both (126-127)
        % This holds back bilinguals, who are often people who have been racialized
          % For example, the ultimate result of the Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was that "bilingual" at this school meant those who were in a program for English deficiency not those who could speak two languages (Rosa 2019:129)
        % Such public discourse can be called linguicism or "'linguistically argued racism'" (Skutnabb-Kangas 1988; Phillipson 1992, as cited in Rosa 2019:139), which is used because biologically argued racism is no longer accepted in public discourse but linguistically argued racism is (Uricuoli 1996, 2001; Zentella 2007, as cited in Rosa 2019:139)
      % Wolfram et al. (2016) looked at style shifting in MLK Jr's language
        % Very local, very focused on social meaning

      Many important findings have been made in terms of race and ethnicity in third wave sociolinguistics, though the one factor that is consistent through the studies already mentioned as well as others is the conflation of race and ethnicity.
      \textcite{reyes_appropriation_2005} mostly discussed both Asian and African American identities as racial though did occasionally frame these as part of ethnic studies, \textcite{newman_you_2011} analyzed Americans of Chinese and Korean heritage but described their speech as indexing an Asian racial identity rather than a national heritage identity (p.~171), and \textcite{mendoza-denton_homegirls:_2008} used ethnicity as more or less a synonym for race or national heritage.
      In analyzing Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech, \textcite{wolfram_significance_2016} consistently discussed his ``ethnic'' background, never his ``racial'' background, though they often described his background as ``black'' and ``African American'', and \textcite{rahman_middle-class_2008} explicitly equated race and ethnicity while framing African-American identity as an ethnic identity.
      Clearly, there is a gap to be explored by unraveling the social categories of race and ethnicity to get a more fine-grained and intersectional understanding of the social and linguistic lives of speakers.
      % Reyes (2005) mostly discussed both Asian and African American identities as racial though did occasionally frame these as part of ethnic studies
        % "Asian Americans share racial minority status with African Americans" (510)
        % "Yet that non-African Americans benefit from appropriating the verbal dress of a group that has been the target of much discrimination and racism in the United States is a complex subject that deserves more attention from scholars of language and ethnicity" (509)
      % At times in Mendoza (2008), ethnicity appears as basically a synonym for race or national heritage
        % Speaking of a discussion with a participant, Mendoza-Denton (2008) explains "that she does not think of herself as ethnically or racially white" (124)
        % Explaining a participant who said that the parents of Norteñxs "are, one American, and one Mexican, much of the time," Mendoza-Denton (2008) says that Norteñxs are understood "as being ethnically mixed" (123)
      % Rahman (2008) consistently discussed African-American identity as an ethnic identity
        % One of the only times race is mentioned is in Table 3 where it is explicitly treated as a synonym for ethnicity (153)

        % Inclusion of more nuanced racial identities has occurred
          % Black-White biracial men in DC were found to have different intonational patterns depending on their self-identifications as singular Black, using the pattern traditionally found to be associated with Black identities in general, versus self-identifications as border, using a pattern that has not traditionally been found to be indexical of Black identities (Holliday 2019:8) 

  \section{Race in Louisiana}
    \label{sec:race_louisiana}
    % In the 1980s, Susie Guillory Phipps sued Louisiana to change her birth certificate race from colored to White but lost (Omi 1997:7-9)
    % Historically
      % The Louisiana Purchase was in 1803 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":107)
      % Quadroon was a label used for people shortly after the Louisiana Purchase who were of one fourth African descent (J. Martin 2000:57; Susberry 2004:9)
      % Octoroon was a label used for people shortly after the Louisiana Purchase who were of one eighth African descent (Susberry 2004:9)
      % Plaçage was a system used in the New World in which White Europeans would establish liaisons with quadroon and octoroon women -- women who weren't allowed to legally marry -- that led to children, in which the women participated in order to gradually obtain lighter skin and higher social status (Bryan 2000; Dunbar-Nelson 2000, T. McNeill 1994, all as cited in Susberry 2004:9; J. Martin 2000:57-58; Klingler 2003 "Turn":15-16)
        % The Black Code gave these children the status of their mothers, thus they were initially enslaved upon birth (Bryan 2000, as cited in Susberry 2004:9)
      % Gens de couleur had more social status than Blacks (enslaved people) but were still not afforded the same status as Whites (Barthelemy 2000; Dunbar-Nelson 2000, both as cited in Susberry 2004:10-11; J. Martin 2000:60)
    At least since the arrival of Europeans in the territory of what is now Louisiana and the horrors of slavery that they brought with them, race has been a complicated issue in Louisiana to say the least.
    Indeed, by the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, children of European and African lineage were commonplace to the point of receiving the racial labels of quadroon or octoroon based on the proportion of Africans in said lineage (\citeauthor{kein_placage_2000}, \citeyear[p.~57]{kein_placage_2000}; \citeauthor{susberry_racial_2004}, \citeyear[p.~9]{susberry_racial_2004}).
    Because of the links between lighter skin and higher social status, quadroon and octoroon women -- who were not allowed to legally marry -- were sometimes willing to enter into liaisons with White Europeans through a system call \foreign{plaçage} and bear children to them (\citeauthor[Bryan, 2000; Dunbar-Nelson, 2000; T. McNeill, 1994, all as cited in][]{susberry_racial_2004}, \citeyear[p.~9]{susberry_racial_2004}; \citeauthor{klingler_if_2003}, \citeyear[pp.~15-16]{klingler_if_2003}; \citeauthor{kein_placage_2000}, \citeyear[pp.~57-58]{kein_placage_2000}).
    The \foreign{Code noir} \gloss{Black Code}, the French decree that regulated slavery, gave children the status of their mothers, thus they were initially enslaved upon birth if their mothers had not been freed or their grandmothers had not been freed, etc. \parencite[Bryan, 2000, as cited in][p.~9]{susberry_racial_2004}.
    However, it did happen that quadroon and octoroon people were freed, such people being referred to as \foreign{Gens de couleur libres} \gloss{Free People of Color}.
    \foreign{Gens de couleur libres} were not the equals of Whites in terms of social status, but they were given more rights and status than Blacks (i.e., enslaved people) (\citeauthor[Barthelemy, 2000; Dunbar-Nelson, 2000, both as cited in][]{susberry_racial_2004}, \citeyear[pp.~10-11]{susberry_racial_2004}; \citeauthor{kein_placage_2000}, \citeyear[p.~60]{kein_placage_2000}).
    Thus, 18th and 19th century Louisiana had at least a three tiered racial system arranged hierarchically so that Blacks were at the bottom, Whites were at the top, and \foreign{Gens de couleur libres} were somewhere in between.

      % For the time between the Louisiana Purchase and the Civil War, francophone Louisianians also attempted to unify around culture and language to enact laws that would prevent incoming "Americans" from participating in local politics (J. Johnson 1976:20)
        % This perhaps suggest a downplaying of race, though it's unclear what sources J. Johnson uses for this or how extensive it really was, and as I note elsewhere, there is evidence that race was still an important social organizing factor among Louisianians
        % Post-Civil War, it wasn't until 1971 that a French-speaking governor was elected: Edwin Edwards (J. Johnson 1976:29)
    With the Louisiana Purchase, there was also naturally an influx of ``Americans'', a term used not just to refer to citizens of the United States but one used even up to the present day to refer to non-francophones from outside of South Louisiana.
    This influx had the potential to erase the local culture of the region, and indeed, \textcite{johnson_louisiana_1976} claimed that White francophone Louisianians also attempted to unify around culture and language to enact laws that would prevent the newcomers from participating in local politics (p.~20), making it clear that even when feeling threatened from the outside, the racial order in Louisiana still held such importance for those in power that they were not willing to allow those of lower social status to join them in their efforts to restrain said outside threat.
    In any case, while these efforts to keep Americans out of local politics had some success, there were already signs of change as the Civil War approached \parencite[p.~20]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.

    % General make-up today
      % The increase in the Latinx-dominant neighborhoods in the US has mostly occurred in the western states (i.e., not Louisiana), according to census records between 1990 and 2010 (Wright et al. 2014:179)
      % It has been argued that ethnicity has become "polarized around race" in Louisiana (Dajko 2012:290)
        % Not only have Cajuns and Creoles been defined by residents according to physical traits but also Indians (Dajko 2007, as cited in Dajko 2012:279-280)
    Today, using words like quadroon or octoroon in public in Louisiana would likely be received poorly, though that is not to say that racial equity and equality have been attained, and in some ways Louisiana may be less diverse than other states.
    For example, while there has been Latinx immigration to the state, census records from 1990 to 2010 indicate that the increase in Latinx-dominant neighborhoods in the US has mostly occurred in the western states rather than places like Louisiana \parencite[p.~179]{wright_patterns_2014}.
    There are also indications that race is just as central to social life in the state as ever.
    It has been argued, for instance, that ethnicity has become ``polarized around race'' \parencite[p.~290]{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}, where perhaps in the past a ethnic group such as the Cajuns would not have been racialized at all.
    Indeed, not only have Cajuns and Creoles been defined by residents according to physical traits but Indians have, as well \parencite[Dajko 2007, as cited in][pp.~279-280]{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}.
    It is fitting then, to take a moment to discuss Creole and Cajun identities.

    \subsection{Creole identity}
      \label{sec:creole_identity}
      % In mid- to late-19th century New Orleans, Creole was still such a general term that it was applied to food as a synonym for local (J. Johnson 1976:21)
        % But for people, the term has been applied to varies groups, such as 1) White Louisianians of French and/or Spanish descent, 2) people of African descent, or 3) people of mixed African and European descent (Dajko 2012:289)
          % Dominguez (1977?) gave «les Blancs de souche européene nés dans les colonies,» Saint-Domingue refugees, «les Noirs francophones et les gens de race mixte,» and «les Noirs créolophones» (as cited in Neumann 1985:11)
      % It has been suggested that 4 factors have helped maintain an interest in Creole identity up to the present: 1) A concern that Louisiana exports being marketed as "Cajun" will erase Creole contributions, 2) the lack of laws or even census options that would pigeonhole Creoles into identifying as Black instead, 3) the focus on French language education, and 4) the popularity of geneological research (Susberry 2004:14)
      The term \lexi{Creole} has a storied history.
      In mid- to late-19th century New Orleans, for example, the term could be used in such a generalized way that it was applied to food as a synonym for local \parencite[p.~21]{johnson_louisiana_1976}.
      For people, however, the term has been applied to groups as varied as White Louisianians of French and/or Spanish descent, people of African descent, and people of mixed African and European descent \parencite[p.~289]{dajko_sociolinguistics_2012}.
      Naturally then, interest in the Creoles and the definition of \lexi{Creole} has been high in Louisiana.
      My own participants were all asked to define what a Creole is, and the topic consistently evoked strong reactions that suggested that the answer for them is long and complicated, especially when the question was put to my Cajun participants.
      When discussing Creoles in terms of non-Whites, \textcite{susberry_racial_2004} suggested that interest has been maintained due to concern over Louisiana exports being marketed as ``Cajun'' and thereby erasing Creole contributions, due to the lack of laws or even census options that lead to pigeonholing Creoles as Black, due to an indirectly related focus on French language education in Louisiana, and due to the popularity of geneological research in the state (p.~14), although on this last point, I would argue that geneological research is popular because Creole and especially Cajun identities are tightly linked to one's ancestry in the minds of residents, as will become apparent in the ensuing discussions.

      % Up to the Louisiana Purchase
        % Around the time of the Louisiana Purchase, Creoles were White descendants of Europeans born in the Americas (Kein 2000, as cited in Susberry 2004:7-8)
          % Fortier (1884) says French and Spanish specifically rather than Europeans (98)
        % Rottet (1995) understood the traditional definition of Creoles as "white descendants of the original immigrants from France and Spain who arrived during the colonial period and who settled in New Orleans and in plantations along the Mississippi north of the city" and later those "who took refuge in Louisiana after the slave insurrection in Santo Domingo" (6)
        % This likely applied broadly to all the New World colonies, as Anderson (1983/2006) also understood Creole and Criollo to mean a "person of (at least theoretically) pure European descent but born in the Americas" (47)
          % Anderson (1983/2006) argued that Creoles were excluded from being Europeans despite being generally indistinguishable physically and cultural, so they felt compelled to hold themselves above locals and mixed people in the New World, which for him "foreshadows modern racism" (59-60)
      While not as common in conceptions of Creoles today, the first uses of the term applied to Europeans (i.e., Whites).
      Around the time of the Louisiana Purchase, Creoles were White descendants of Europeans born in the Americas \parencite[Kein, 2000, as cited in][pp.~7-8]{susberry_racial_2004}.
      Being even more specific, \textcite{fortier_french_1884} explained that Creoles were French and Spanish descendants rather than simple Europeans (p.~98), which would seem to preclude other early colonizers such as Germans who had been arriving in Louisiana as early as 1721 \parencite[Trépanier, 1988, as cited in][p.~91]{rottet_language_1995}.
      \citeauthor{rottet_language_1995}'s (\citeyear{rottet_language_1995}) understanding of the traditional definiton of Creoles was likewise ``white descendants of the original immigrants from France and Spain who arrived during the colonial period and who settled in New Orleans and in plantations along the Mississippi north of the city'' who were only later redefined as those ``who took refuge in Louisiana after the slave insurrection in Santo Domingo [Saint-Domingue > Haiti]'' (p.~6).
      Again, this definition of early Creoles highlights French and Spanish ancestry.

      % After the Louisiana Purchase
        % After the Louisiana Purchase, Creole eventually came to be the name for "mixed race people of color" (Martin 2000, as cited in Susberry 2004:7-8)
          % Although White Creoles, at least in New Orleans, "occupied a high standing" (Fortier 1884:98)
        % J. Johnson (1976) suggests that, in the 19th century, a "creole Negro" was an enslaved person who spoke French and sometimes "the free black French-speaking population" (25)
          % He doesn't give a source for this, and as the work of others has suggested, this is probably an oversimplification
        % White Americans and White Creoles were already attempting to socially collapse Free People of Color in with enslaved Blacks by 1830, though these efforts weren't very successful (Daniel 1992; Gehman 1994; Bryan 2000, all as cited in Susberry 2004:10-11)
      % After the Civil War
        % After the Civil War, poverty (Gehman 1994) and the abolishment of slavery became factors that made it easier for Whites to collapse Creoles of Color into the same social category as Blacks (previously enslaved people) (Susberry 2004:11)
          % In the 20th century, Creoles of Color themselves tended to align themselves with Blacks between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement despite seeing themselves as culturally distinct (Dubois & Melançon 2000; Gehman 1994, both as cited in Susberry 2004:12)
          % For Creoles of Color who resented being classified as Black would either try to pass as White if possible or simply assert that they were racially Creole rather than Black (Susberry 2004:12-13)
        % As for White Creoles
          % They began calling themselves Cajun in 1977 (Trépanier 1988, 1991, as cited in Dajko 2012:289)
          % However, some who identify as White also identify as Creole today, often as a result of learning later in life about their ancestry or about other conceptualizations of Creole and Cajun
            % This is perhaps somewhat like Jimenez's (2010) affiliative ethnicity which refers to when someone adopts an ethnicity that they know to not be a part of their own ancestry (as cited in Waters 2014:767)
      % Some definitions used by researchers today
        % "Multiracial people whose ancestral history is connected to Louisiana" (Susberry 2004:8)
        % Mixed race people with French cultural origins (Giancarlo 2019:34), though she argues that a common thread in thread in researchers' definitions is that Creoles are necessarily not Cajuns
    \subsection{Cajun identity}
      \label{sec:cajun_identity}
      % Cajuns were historically seen as racially "ambiguous", "not black, but seen as less white than the Anglo-Saxons" (Tentchoff 1980; Walton 2003, both as cited in Giancarlo 2019:32)
        % Indeed, Cajuns began owning enslaved people in the 1770s and most did by 1810 (Brasseaux 1985), most being as much as 68% (Baker 1974, both as cited in Giancarlo 2019:31)
          % Neumann (1985) likewise claimed that some prosperous Cajuns in Saint Martin Parish owned slaves (13)
        % When "Americans" arrived, they described Cajuns as poor, rural, White francophones (Brasseaux, as cited in Dajko 2012:289)
          % H. Smith & Phillips (1939) claimed that Cajuns lacked mobility due to being poor farmers (198)
          % Neumann (1985) described pre-20th century Cajuns in Saint Martin Parish as fishers, farmers, trappers, and hunters (13)
          % Cajuns continued to be described as isolated from the broader culture of the US even up to the 1930s when one sociologist described them as the "largest unassimilated minority" in the US (Gilmore 1933, as cited in Rottet 1995:99)
        % Rottet (1995) claims that there was stigma attached to the term Cajun where it once was "synonymous with poor white trash" but is not longer stigmatized (110)
      % Their origin myth is heavily focused on the Grand dérangement
        % The Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia in 1755 (B. Brown 1986:399; Klingler 2003 "Turn":18-19; Neumann 1985:13)
          % This came about because Acadia was ceded to the British in 1713 who insisted that the Acadians swear an oath to Britain so that they would fight against France in the case of war. The Acadians refused, and by 1755, the suspicious British forcibly exiled half of them (along with burning their farms and such) (Rottet 1995:94)
          % Acadians themselves have been said to arrive in Canada from Poitou, Brittany, Normandy, Aunis, Saintonge, and Angoumois (Brasseaux 2005, as cited in Dajko 2012:281-282;  Massignon 1962, as cited in Rottet 1995:93; R. A. Brown 1988:16; Klingler 2003 "Turn":19; King 2000:1)
          % They initially settled in The Acadian/German Coast (along the Mississippi in St James Parish), Opelousas, and the Attakapas (Klingler 2003 "Turn":100; Neumann 1985:13; Fortier 1884:99; Brasseaux 1987, as cited in Dajko 2012:284)
            % There numbers have been estimated to be between 1,500 and 10,000 (Ficatier 1957, as cited in Neumann 1985:9; Brasseaux 1992; Leblanc 1979; Taylor 1984; the latter three as cited in Rottet 1995:96; Klingler 2009, as cited in Dajko 2012:283)
        % The term Cajun itself comes from "Acadian" (H. Smith & Phillips 1939:198)
          % Alveolar stops before vowels and especially /j/ are affricated in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:77)
        % Place in terms of the geographic origin has indeed been cited as the primary criteria for claiming Cajun identity (e.g., Esman 1981, as cited in Lindner 2008:51)
        % In surveying college students, Ryon (2000) found that 48% of men and 35% of women thought Acadian heritage was an important criteria for claiming Cajun identity (as cited in Lindner 2008:59)
        % There are reasons to believe that the Acadian origin myth is everpresent when speaking to Louisianians about Cajun identity, but membership isn't as simple as ancestry in practice
      % Cajun membership
        % Non-racial criteria
          % Ryon's (2000) college students also reported foodways and religion as important factors for claiming Cajun identity: 45% of men and 51% of women (as cited in Lindner 2008:59)
          % Dajko (2012) suggests one can establish membership through 1) foodways, 2) music, 3) language (French), 4) "and until recently, the Catholic faith", which she also applies as valid criteria for Creole membership (280)
          % Del Sesto & Gibson (1975) defined a Cajun as an individual from Louisiana who is Catholic, rural, privileges kinship relations, and speaks or knows speakers of Louisiana French (as cited in Neumann 1985:15)
          % French fluency as a criteria
            % Among college students, 42% of men and 63% of women who identified as Cajun did not speak French with their families (Ryon 2000, as cited in Lindner 2008:59)
            % Among college students, Ryon (2000) found that all men with francophone family ties claimed Cajun identity, but 34% of the women who had francophone family ties did not claim Cajun identity, and over half of that subset of women (58%) had negative evaluations of Louisiana French compared to 8% of Cajun-identifying women (as cited in Lindner 2008:57-58)
            % In Tornquist's (2000) survey of parents, only 17% identifying as "American" spoke French to some degree whereas 58% identifying as "Cajun" and 53% identifying as "Creole of African origin" spoke French (as cited in Lindner 2008:61)
      % Giancarlo (2019) argues that characterizing all White South Louisianians as Cajun "minimizes a diversity of white ethnicities" (33)
        % She seems to mean that White South Louisianians might otherwise maintain different ethnic identities rather than that the racial identities aligned with Cajun identity
        % We might call this a case of erasure (Irvine & Gal 2000:38)
        % Cajuns weren't necessarily good at forming sociopolitical alliances with other groups
          % In the 19th century, Cajuns were Catholic like many New Orleanians but didn't form sociopolitical alliances with them due to a "urban-rural antipathy," and they were rural like northern Louisianians but didn't form alliances because Northerners were "rabid anti-Catholic Protestants" (J. Johnson 1976:27)
        % Other ethnic groups (Scots-Irish, Italians, Germans, some Native Americans) have been incorporated in the Cajun ethnicity, so ancestry and last names have been argued to not be necessary conditions for Cajun identity (Brasseaux 1992; Stanford 2016, both as cited in Giancarlo 2019:33)
          % B. Brown (1988) had previously noted that "someone who calls himself a Cajun today is no longer necessarily of Acadian ancestry" (18-20)
            % In Avoyelles and Pierre Part, the former is made up of people of mostly European ancestry and the latter Acadian despite the fact that they all "generally associate themselves with Cajun identity" (B. Brown 1988:22)
          % But the explicit incorporation of various people under the Cajun label was taking place much earlier at least to some extent
            % H. Smith & Phillips (1939) defined Cajuns as "French-speaking people" of "South Louisiana" who are "of French descent," be it Acadian or otherwise (198)
          % A similar change has been occurring with Acadian identity in the Maritime Provinces where membership was once based on ancestry but now more broadly includes any francophone living in these provinces (Arrighi 2014:110)
        % All this isn't to say that ancestry is not important in how Cajuns IMAGINE membership works until they are reminded that those with non-Acadian names also identify as Cajun
          % Moerman (1965), in his study of the Lue in Thailand, argued that ethnic membership comes simply from people perceiving themselves as belonging to the same ethnic category (as cited in Eriksen 1993/2010:15-16)
            % This has been echoed by others (Giles 1979, as cited in Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:2; Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:2)
  \section{Status of French and Creole in Louisiana today}
    % The importation of French into Louisiana is mostly simple as Louisiana was a French colony, but what happened after isn't as simple
      % Louisiana was claimed in 1682 by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle of French Canada (Neumann 1985:8)
        % Louisiana wasn't really explored and colonized until 1698 by Pierre Le Moyne (Sieur d'Iberville) and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne (Sieur de Bienville) (Neumann 1985:8)
      % Although Acadian French is at least implicitly considered the main origin of French in rural Louisiana, there are many sources for French (Klingler 2009)
        % They didn't make up a particularly large proportion of the Louisiana populace
          % During the first half of the 19th century along Bayou Lafourche, French-speaking immigrants outnumbered Acadians by 3 to 2 (Brasseaux 1992, as cited in Dajko 2012:285)
          % Only 5% of the population in the 1980s was estimated to have Acadian ancestry (or the population had only 5% Acadian ancestry?) (Esman 1985, as cited in B. Brown 1988:21-22)
            % Interestingly enough, B. Brown (1988) in the same passage argues that Acadian solidarity helped led their culture to be dominant even though they made up a minority of the population (21-22)
        % There was sustained contact with France and immigration from France all the way up to the Civil War (Brasseaux 2005; Picone 1997, both as cited in Dajko 2012:280)
        % J. Johnson (1976) describes all francophones in Louisiana as descending from four groups: 1) L'ancienne population (those from France who settled in New Orleans and along the Mississippi starting in 1718), 2) les français étrangers (those from France that came later), 3) Cajuns (those from Nova Scotia starting in 1755), and 4) those from Santo Domingo starting in 1791 (19)
          % He doesn't actually give sources for these
          % The original French settlers came from 6 provinces: 1) Île-de-France, 2) Brittany (Bretagne), 3) Champagne, 4) Poitou, 5) Aunis, and 6) Burgundy (Bourgogne) (Brasseaux 1987, as cited in Dajko 2012:281)
          % During Spanish control from 1762 to 1800, the population grew from about 11,000 people to 50,000, made up mostly of French-speaking people (e.g., Acadian refugees, French Revolution exiles) (Rottet 1995:93)
            % Most of the French immigrants came from Guyenne and Provence (Brasseaux 2005, as cited in Dajko 2012:282)
            % Acadians themselves had originated from west central France (King 2000:1)
          % The bulk of Saint-Domingue migrants arrived in 1809 and 1810 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":22/79) and settled in New Orleans (Debien & Le Gardeur 1981, as cited in Klingler 2003 "Turn":22)
            % In 1788, the racial demographics of Saint-Domingue included approximately 28,000 Whites, 22,000 free people of color, and 405,000 enslaved people (Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:50, citing the census)
            % Haitian independence was achieved in 1804 (Le Page & Tabouret 1985:50)
            % About 10,000 Saint-Domingue refugees moved to Louisiana in 1810 (Debien & Le Gardeur 1981, as cited in Neumann 1985:9-10)
            % However, Neumann (1985) claimed that there were already migrants from Saint-Domingue in Saint Martinville in the 18th century (7)
        % Fortier (1884) described the French of Louisiana as having a "purity" due to men of rich families almost always being educated in France "during the old regime" (99)
          % But despite this being a general description of French in the state, it's not a description of Acadian French, suggesting the presence of other French-speaking groups
            % Fortier (1884) complained that the Acadians who arrived "did not contribute toward keeping the French language in a state of purity" (99)
              % Some examples Fortier (1884) gives of the "not very elegant" French of the Acadians: j'avions et j'étions, paré for prêt, il mouille for il pleut (99)
                % 1pl je is in fact a feature found even now in Acadian French (King 2000; Comeau & King 2007, both cited in King 2008:140)
        % In fact, Arrighi (2014), a researcher focused on Acadian French, has even argued that data from Louisiana should be excluded from descriptions in the literature of "français acadien" (107)
      % In the 19th century, French, Creole, and English were all spoken widely
        % Enough so that the Louisiana legislature purportedly had appointed interpreters (Gayarré, as cited in Fortier 1884:97-98)
          % In 1812, English was in fact the official language of the legislature, but work continued in both English and French up until it was abolished in 1916 (J. Johnson 1976:29/37-38)
          % The 1845 state connstitution required the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house of representatives to be bilingual (Rottet 1995:102)
          % French language newspapers existed
            % Le Moniteur de la Louisiane (1794 by Louis Duclot) was the first, L'Abeille (until 1925, "most famous"), L'Ami des Lois, Le Courrier de la Louisiane, and Le Propagateur Catholique were important, and Le Courrier de la Nouvelle-Orléans (1902-1955, though it struggled) was the last exclusively in French (J. Johnson 1976:22)
            % These stopped being published in Pointe Coupee in 1872 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":108)
            % Even as late as the 1970s, the bilingual Acadiana Profile was launched (J. Johnson 1976:29), but this was clearly a niche item at that point
        % As I mentioned elsewhere, there were efforts to unify around language between the Louisiana Purchase and Civil War to resist the influence of "American" immigrants (J. Johnson 1976:20)
      % 20th century
        % Numbers
          % The decline became rapid after 1900 in New Orleans and especially after WWI (J. Johnson 1976:22), though he gives no sources for this
            % The last holdouts were unemployed wives up until WWI (J. Johnson 1976:22)
            % Elsewhere the decline has not been nearly as rapid
              % H. Smith & Phillips (1939), while studying Evangeline Parish, reported that 90% of South Louisiana spoke French (198)
                % This was probably a guess, but the extremely high percentage suggests that it was so prevalent as to feel like it was everywhere
          % J. Johnson (1976) describes Cajuns in particular as being rather isolated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in comparison with other francophone populations, resulting in their greater continued use of French (28)
            % Conrad (1978) outlined four driving forces behind the Americanization of Cajuns: 1) compulsory education, 2) mass communication, 3) World War II, and 4) the oil boom (as cited in B. Brown 1988:28)
              % With this Americanization came less isolation and greater use of English
              % Neumann (1985) specifically argued that compulsory education and the oil boom were behind the shift from Creole to English (49)
            % Highway connections
              % Even by J. Johnson's time, it was estimated that 60% of Cajuns lived in rural areas (Bobo & Charlton 1974, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:27)
              % Gold (1976) suggests that, for Mamou, isolation from Lake Charles and Lafayette only diminished after highways were built (268)
              % Those living in swamp areas didn't have highways until the 1950s, some in Bayou Lafourche were still going to school by boat in the 1970s, and I-10 was not completed until 1975 (B. Brown 1988:26-27, possibly citing Padgett 1969 for the first two points)
            % Likewise, Pointe Coupee Creole was in part maintained due to 19th century residents being insular to the point of marrying cousins as a norm (Klingler 2003 "Turn":109)
            % Likewise again, during segregation, Indians weren't allowed in White schools but also refused to go to Black schools (Rottet 1995:61-62)
              % This highlights the isolation of French-speaking communities, how that isolation can help maintain the language as Indians were maintaining it better than others in their area, and how a racial binary was impacting that those didn't fit neatly into either category
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, the decline in French has been said to have started in the 1940s (Western 1971, as cited in Rottet 1995:105)
            % It has been argued that the decline in French in Lafourche Parish in the 1940s came from most people working in the oil industry as it developed there were from North Louisiana or Texas and so the locals saw these non-Cajuns as gaining wealth and attributed their own poverty to their ethnicity (Larouche 1981, as cited in Rottet 1995:105)
          % Rottet (1995) explained that census numbers are sometimes misleading as glossonyms may be more or less specific than what residences expect, leading to misunderstanding (B. Brown 1993, as cited in Rottet 1995:98), and the questions have changed at different times such as the 1970 census asking about the childhood home language whereas the 1990 census asked what language is currently spoken at home (Rottet 1995:112-113)
            % On the 1970 census, 572,262 Louisianians reported French as their mothertongue (as cited in J. Johnson 1976:19/36 and in Neumann 1985:16)
              % CODOFIL itself estimated much higher around this time: 1.5 million (J. Johnson 1976:36)
          % When looking at children, there's a repeated pattern of decline
            % Among all children in Evangeline Parish and Pointe Coupee Parish in 1960, it was estimated that, as children, 38% spoke French, 53% spoke English, and 9% spoke both (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:32)
              % Among Black children in Evangeline Parish and Pointe Coupee Parish in 1960, it was estimated that 31% had a French background and 69% an English (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in J. Johnson 1976:33)
              % 68% of those in Evangeline and Pointe Coupee who spoke French during their childhood still spoke it frequently as adults in 1960 (Bertrand & Beale 1965, as cited in Rottet 1995:113-114)
            % The 1980 census estimated the percentage of those who speak French at home in Avoyelles and Assumption Parishes was 45% and 30%, respectively, when looking at those 18 or older, but 13% and 7% for those between 5 and 17 (as cited in B. Brown 1988:79)
            % Trépanier (1988) reported 41% of respondents saying that they spoke French best whereas those respondents reported that 92% of their grandparents, 84% of their parents, and 3% of their children spoke French best (as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
            % CODOFIL carried out another survey later that estimated that 40.6% based on the 8 parishes surveyed, 42.5% of those people being over 45 and 24% being under 19 (Henry 1990, as cited in Rottet 1995:115-116)
          % By the 1980s, French was in decline towards English in all regions except 1) Southwest Louisiana, 2) Pigeon and Pierre Part, and 3) Lower Lafourche and Terrebonne where bilingualism was the norm (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
            % Smith-Thibodeaux (1977) estimated 300,000 to 500,000 (as cited in Rottet 1995:113)
            % Neumann (1985) estimated 500,000 to 1 million, additionally estimating 60,000 to 80,000 Creole speakers (as cited in Rottet 1995:113)
            % French was the mothertongue of 35% of the population of Houma, 39% of Thibodeaux, and 60% of rural Terrebonne-Lafourche (1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:114)
            % Rottet (1995) didn't find any monolingual French speakers in Terrebonne-Lafourche (162)
              % Not long before this in the 1970s, Gibson & Del Sesto (1975) suspected that monolingual French speakers existed still but only among the older portions of the population (as cited in Lindner 2008:39)
        % Cultural indicators
          % Politics
            % The language of instruction of public schools was set as English only in the early part of the 20th century (Constitution of the State of Louisiana 1921:93, Section 12)
              % In fact, not a single mention of the word French appears though several mentions of English as a requirement for certain posts appear
              % This is similar to the turning points for other minority languages
                % In New Zealand, Maori was banned from schools in the mid 19th century (Bell 2014:62-63)
            % As I mentioned elsewhere, Edwin Edwards, in 1971, became the first French-speaking governor elected since the Civil War (J. Johnson 1976:29)
            % Act no 256, pushed for by CODOFIL, made French a co-official language in the state with English (Rottet 1995:106)
            % Act no 263 allowed local governments to replace English highway signs with English-French bilingual signs (Ortego & Lafleur 2014)
          % It has been reported generally that Cajuns had taken "great pride" in their language by the 1970s, hence the establishment of CODOFIL in 1968 (J. Johnson 1976:28)
            % CODOFIL did not promote French among Black and Indian Louisianians, which has led to criticism that it cultivated the identity of French Louisianians as White (Waddell 1983, as cited in Rottet 1995:109)
          % Education and immersion programs
            % Cajuns had access to "two years of elective French courses in high school" (H. Smith & Phillips 1939:199) even though regular instruction was already outlawed by that time
              % Much later in the 20th century, this access in high school was said to be decreasing (Landry et al. 1996, as cited in Lindner 2008:39)
            % CODOFIL was bringing in an estimated 200 foreign francophone teachers each year to teach roughly 40,000 students (J. Johnson 1976:29)
              % Importantly, these teachers were using textbooks from France (J. Johnson 1976:28)
                % Through the 20th century at least, there was only one textbook based on Louisiana French, the variety of Vermilion by Faulk (1977), but it was never used in schools (Rottet 1995:110)
            % Immersion programs began in 1979 in Baton Rouge, and by 1994 there were programs in Lafayette, Orleans, Assumption, Calcasieu, and St Martin (Rottet 1995:107)
            % By 1993, there were 80,000 or more immersion school students and most teachers were native Louisianians (650 of the 825) (Acadiana Profile, as cited in Rottet 1995:107)
            % Benton (2008) reported that 900 of the 30,000 students (3%) in the Lafayette Parish school district were in immersion schooling (as cited in Lindner 2008:45-46)
              % French immersion was available in Lafayette Parish from kindergarten to 8th grade, though after 5th grade, immersion was only for half the day (Lindner 2008:67)
            % Schools technically had to offer 5 years of French but could be granted an exception via a simple request for one (Acadiana Profile 1970, as cited in Rottet 1995:106)
            % Much of CODOFIL's efforts have been focused on school immersion programs
              % It has been argued that, for language revitalization, focusing on schools is helpful but has a limited impact (Hornberger & King 1996, as cited in Rindstedt & Aronsson 2002:723)
                % Fishman (1991) likewise argued that schools alone aren't enough for revitalizing language in that "'it still requires extensive and recurring pre-school, out-of-school and post-school societal reinforcement, particularly if its initiatory efforts are to become cumulative and intergenerationally transmissible'" (as cited in Lindner 2008:17-18)
                  % This is indeed what has been seen with Breton in Brittany as it's still in decline despite having education programs (Gemie 2002, as cited in Lindner 2008:25)
                % This is perhaps doubly true for non-immersion language education, as Bankston & Henry (2002) claimed that, among those students, only "'very few have achieved fluency or even developed an interest in the language'" by the end of the 1990s (as cited in Lindner 2008:43)
              % Educators in general have also been argued to be effectively pushing towards a standard which sometimes means "the rejection of the norms of home usage," as Le Page (1968) found in Creole-speaking countries (as cited in Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985:184)
                % A similar issue in Louisiana programs not only because Hexagonal French could be promoted over Louisiana French but even Louisiana French over Louisiana Creole
          % Media
            % Media that glorifies a dominant language and culture has been seen to spur on the decline of Dyirbal in Australia (Schmidt 1985) and Nahuatl in Mexico (Hill & Hill 1977, as cited in Rottet 1995:21-22)
            % Shortly after the establishment of CODOFIL in 1968 (About CODOFIL 2023), said founding largely due to efforts of James Domengeaux (Gold 1982, as cited in Lindner 2008:39-40), the Louisiana legislature launched Télévision-Louisiane as a non-profit French-language television broadcasting corporation (J. Johnson 1976:29)
            % Louisiana Public Broadcasting (LPB) broadcast the French-language talk show En Français 4 hours per week (Rottet 1995:108)
            % Rottet's (1995) participants in Terrebonne-Lafourche reported listening to French music on the radio but only a handful listened to the limited amount of French talk broadcasts available (146-147)
          % Writing
            % The written language has been argued to help generate a national consciousness (Anderson 1983/2006:44-45)
              % Generating sociolinguistic consciousness is likewise possible
            % As I mentioned elsewhere, the bilingual newspaper the Acadiana Profile began being published in the 1970s (J. Johnson 1976:29)
            % Most but not all of Rottet's (1995) participants were illiterate in French, 10 of 71 reporting reading at least rarely (146)
            % Only 3 of Rottet's (1995) participants wrote letters in French, 2 older and 1 middle (146)
            % Only 2 of Blainey's (2013) 33 participants in Golden Meadows were literate due to having some "very limited" self-taught knowledge (71)
          % Religion
            % In 1920, 1/3rd of Catholic churches in Acadiana held services in French, but that number shrank to just 3 by the 1980s (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:103-104)
            % In 1981, 27% of Baptist churches in Acadiana "used French at least occasionally" (Trépanier 1988, as cited in Rottet 1995:104)
        % 20th century projections
          % Given the general decline in numbers over time, it's not surprising that researchers have been projecting the demise of French for a while
            % For Cajuns, Bernard (2003) reported that those who speak French as a first language has declined from 83% in the early 1900s to 21% between 1956 and 1960 to 3% in 1980 (as cited in Lindner 2008:37)
            % Rottet (2001) reported that in Terrebonne-Lafourche, 31% of those over 55 spoke French to their children, 10% of those between  30 and 54, and none of those under 30 (as cited in Lindner 2008:38)
          % J. Johnson (1976) predicted, using crude methods, that native French-speaking families in Louisiana would cease to exist by 2010 (34-35)
            % This has not panned out, but the consensus is generally that the language is disappearing, perhaps through through Campbell & Muntzel's (1989) concept of gradual language death rather than radical language death (as cited in Bell 2014:89) as earlier projections seemed ready to announce
          % B. Brown (1988) considered conclusions about the inevitable death of French in Louisiana as "premature" in light of the Cajun renaissance (48-49) which will be discussed more in the meaning chapter
          % Rottet (1995) believed that the communities in Terrebonne-Lafourche are going through a language shift (6) and wagered that the prospects for French were "much better than for Louisiana French Creole" but "not particularly good" (112)
            % A language shift is the process by which a speech community of a language comes to speak a different langauge to the exclusion of the first (Weinreich 1953/1967:68/94-95)
            % Indeed, Rottet (1995) shows that there is a shift from using almost always French in all social contexts to mostly English (137-138)
            % This is constrained by ethnicity where Cajuns have increased their use of French in some contexts but decreased in others whereas Indians have decreased in all contexts (Rottet 1995:139)
              % This feels likely due to where the starting point is since French was more prevalent for Indians in Terrebonne-Lafourche and even being passed on to children still (Rottet 1995:71)
            % Neumann (1985) reported that creolophones in Breaux Bridge used the language only with «des amis ou des personnes de même niveau social» (25)
            % B. Brown (1988) specifically looked for and found participants who preferred French in all domains in Avoyelles and Assumption (70)
            % The shrinking domains of use that Rottet (1995) reported were just prior to his study reported by CODOFIL where they estimated that almost all French interactions are with friends and family as opposed to the workplace (and by extension public uses in general) (Henry 1990, as cited in Rottet 1995:115-116)
            % A shrinking number of contexts is what one expects for endangered languages
              % In Wisconsin West Frisian, a heritage language, the language is limited to "social gatherings among the remaining speakers" (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:237)
              % This is essentially what J. Fishman (1967/2000) was talking about when he said that the existence of widespread individual bilingualism without diglossia generally implies a transitional period (79)
                % There is still arguably widespread bilingualism in Louisiana, but diglossia let alone diglossia where French is dominant is certainly not a thing that exists today
                  % Neumann (1985) in her time even reported that diglossia was not a thing because younger people simply always used English (27-28)
                % Ferguson (1959/2000) suggested the (national) circumstances needed for a diglossic situation to disappear: 1) widespread literacy, 2) broader communication between segments of the community, and 3) a push for "a full-fledged standard 'national' language" (70)
                  % Louisianians have become more literate in English, developed more communication with those outside of the South Louisiana communities, and a national language has been being pushed since Theodore Roosevelt at least
        % 21st century indications
          % Marcoux et al. (2022) estimated that there are about 84,000 French speakers in Louisiana (128)
          % We could perhaps talk about F&C as heritage languages at this point
            % Heritage language definitions
              % A language "acquired as an L1 in a natural setting, typically in the home or the community" (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:235)
          % It has been claimed that English was dominant in "French Louisiana" (Blyth 1997; Valdman 1997, both as cited in B. Brown 2003:4)
          % Gudmestad & Carmichael (2022) had a number of study participants (Indians) who were native speakers in their 30s (in 2007-2008) in Terrebonne-Lafourche (6-7)
          % Lindner (2008) studied high school students in her work on attitudes towards Louisiana French because they were expected to be the last generation of Louisianians exposed to French from their families (5-6)
          % As for Creole, which may or may not be included in counts, which sometimes is and sometimes isn't made clear
            % As Marshall (1996) pointed out, the label Cajun is generally used for "anyone who speaks French or has some French heritage" despite there being many different groups who speak French or Creole in the state (as cited in Lindner 2008:51)
            % Neumann (1985) estimated 60,000 to 80,000 at the time of which she also estimated 50,000 to 60,000 were Black, respectively (20)
            % Klingler (2005) estimated that there were less than 30,000 Creole speakers (351), but it's not clear what that number is based on
    \subsection{Defining a language as a Creole}
      % Indeed, Creole often appears as an afterthought when discussing the status of "French" in Louisiana, so it is appropriate to spend some time here specifically outlining its place
      % There have been attempts to define creoles as distinctive due to shared structural features
        % McWhorter (2011) offered 4 linguistic features that would also indicate that creoles develop from pidgins, but at least Aboh & deGraff (2017) reject this (14)
          % Aboh & deGraff (2017), based on many examples, instead argue that the linguistic structure these languages take on is always based on the languages that are in contact (16)
        % This often means arguing that creoles are simpler than other languages
          % It has been argued as a counter-example that Haitian Creole NPs are more complex than both French and Gbe NPs (Aboh & deGraff 2017:12)
      % But what makes a creole is the sociohistorical circumstances of its development
        % Mintz (1971) suggested that creoles only come about if the right conditions are met for demographics, social relationships, and the community setting (481)
        % Historically, the argument has been that creoles develop from pidgins, so the the conditions needed for pidgins were the right ones
          % Mufwene (2008) argued that this is incorrect, citing Chaudenson's gradual basilectalization idea as being correct, apparently under the assumption that there was always a homestead stage (10)
        % In the colonial period, slavery was much more prevalent in the south (39.8% of pop) than the the middle colonies (7.0%) and New England (3.1%) (Franklin & Moss 1988, as cited in Rickford 1997:320)
          % Bickert (1981) has argued that as much as 80% of the population needs to be substrate speakers for a creole to emerge (as cited in Rickford 1997:317)
    \subsection{Historical development of Creole in Louisiana}
      % Where did Creole come from in the first place
        % Slavery
          % There were initially 5,310 enslaved people brought to Louisiana in the early 1700s from The Senegal Concession (Sierra Leone in the south to Mauritania in the north), the Gulf of Benin, and Angola (Cabinda specifically) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":6)
            % 1719 was the first year, and most were Bambara with some being Wolof and some Serer (Usner 1992, as cited in Rottet 1995:91)
          % Enslaved people made up 41% of the population in 1726 and 60% in 1732 (Rottet 1995:91)
          % When the Spanish took over Louisiana in 1762 up until 1800, the number of enslaved people in Louisiana increased from ~4,600 to ~24,000 (Hall 1992, as cited in Klingler 2003 "Turn":20)
            % Of the roughly 55% of those whose origins are know during this time, they were 55% African, 37% Creole (born in the Louisiana), and 4% from English-speaking regions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":20-21)
          % In 1788 in Pointe Coupee, enslaved people outnumbered free people by about 3 to 1 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":103)
          % The foreign importation of enslaved people was banned in 1804 (Klingler 2003 "Turn":67)
            % Enslaved people could still be moved from elsewhere in the US to Louisiana
          % By 1860, 76% of the large plantations (more than 50 enslaved people) in Pointe Coupee were owned by "Americans" (Costello 1999, as cited in Klingler 2003 "Turn":107)
        % People who were enslaved and transported from Senagambia mainly spoke Malinke/Maninka, Serer, Wolof, or Pulaar (Klingler 2003 "Turn":57)
        % African languages may be responsible features such as (Klingler 2003 "Turn":62-66):
          % Predicate clefting in which an adjective is repeated in its usual location (e.g., Se malad li malad)
          % Preverbal markers
          % Frequent copula absence
          % Postnominal definite and demonstrative determiners
          % The plural postnominal definite article being identical to the 3pl subject pronoun
        % Who speaks it today generally
          % In Pointe Coupee, more Whites, because the influx of English speaking slaves brought to the area in the 19th century meant that black slaves often learned English before their white owners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":108)
    \subsection{French vs Creole}
      \label{sec:french_vs_creole}
      % My approach here is to analyze French and Creole together as one would do in cases where there is no controversy over whether two varieties are part of the same language or not
        % This isn't a stance on the sociopolitical question, as will be discussed in this section, but rather a methodological choice made in order to better understand race and ethnicity in language
          % Somewhat similar to Benor's (2010) explanation that, when analyzing language from her ethnolinguistic repertoire framework, it is "moot" whether one is discussing ethnic variation or ethnolects since the focus is not on language labeling practices but rather on fluid linguistic structure (170)
      % French and Creole varieties that exist
        % "Cajun French" (though he prefers "Louisiana Regional French" as it is not spoken purely by Cajuns), "Louisiana Creole", and "Colonial French" (which he and Picone (1998) prefer to call Plantation Society French since it developed in the 19th century) (Klingler 2003 "Language":77)
        % Colonial French/Plantation Society French, Louisiana Creole, and Cajun French/Louisiana Regional French (Dajko 2012:280-281)
          % Colonial French is likely no longer extant, though Smith-Thibault (1977) had estimated there to be 3,000 to 4,000 speakers still in the mid 20th century (as cited in B. Brown 1988:37-38)
        % Louisiana Regional French (Dajko & Carmichael 2014)
        % B. Brown (1988) used "Louisiana French" as an umbrella term for Colonial French (spoken by descendants of European Creoles), Cajun French (spoken by Acadians and those absorbed into their culture), and 3) Creole French (spoken by descendants of slaves and those absorbed into their culture) (34-35)
          % The fact that she included Creole typifies the close connection between the two ways of speaking, though the fact that Louisiana French is the umbrella term also risks erasure of Creole
        % Neumann (1985) used «français louisianais» as an umbrella term for Standard and Colonial French but not for any other local varieties, and suggested that this was the language not just of the first colonists but also Saint-Domingue refugees (17)
        % Neumann (1985) explained that le créole louisianais, le «cajun» («un dialecte du français»), un peu de français standard, and l'anglais were in contact at the time of her study (1)
      % Speakers' approaches to naming their languages as one or the other
        % It's not unusual to place languages under a label based on cultural traits of the speakers rather than the structure of their ways of speaking
          % Linguists once described Cangin as a variety of Serer because Wolofs in the area saw the cultural practices of both Cangin and Sereer speakers as being the same (Irvine & Gal 2000:57)
        % For Louisiana, Klingler (2005) suggested that "français", "cadien", and "créole" were the most common glossonyms (352)
          % When a variety that's structurally not characteristic of what has been called Creole is implicated
            % Rottet (1995) reported in Terrebonne-Lafourche that participants, when being specific, called their language français cadien but otherwise français (8)
          % When asked plainly (without pushing for greater specificity), speakers of both varieties in St Landry will call their language "French" (Klingler 2003 "Language":78-79)
            % Apparently Spitzer (1977) and Le Menestrel (1999) have also noted this labeling approach by speakers.
            % B. Brown (1988) also reported this approach, saying that they would call it "français" and sometimes "cadien" (5)
          % Creole speakers in Pointe Coupee had "a clear sense of belonging to a broader world of people who speak 'French'" (Klingler 2003 "Turn":128)
            % Creole speakers in Pointe Coupee (determined by the language structure) mostly call their language "créole" but sometimes also "français" or "cadien", though even when using the latter two glossonyms, speakers note that their language isn't like French from France or Cajun from Lafayette (Klingler 2003 "Turn":128)
              % Indeed, Bertrand & Beale (1965) characterized Black children from Pointe Coupee as being from English or "French" backgrounds (as cited in J. Johnson 1976:33) rather than Creole backgrounds, yet Klingler by the 1990s was describing speakers in this parish as using Creole features almost to the exclusion of French marked variants
      % Regardless of naming approaches, there is evidence of mutual intelligibility between all these ways of speaking
        % Some have cast doubt on mutual intelligibility when talking about the promotion of SF in schools
          % Waddell (1993) claimed that LF speakers in the 1970s were unable to understand the SF taught in schools as it appeared to them as "'a different, unintelligible, language'" (as cited in Lindner 2008:40)
          % Though repeated often by scholars and laypersons, this is likely a gross overstatement
            % Maybe due to opposition to SF in schools more so than real unintelligibility?
              % Most self-identifying Cajuns (58%) wanted Cajun French or a mix of CF and SF used in immersion programs as opposed to 24% for only SF (Tornquist 2000, as cited in Lindner 2008:63)
        % Creole speakers in Pointe Coupee spoke of being able to successfully communicate with French speakers from both inside of and outside of Louisiana, although some French speakers have described comprehension as difficult (Klingler 2003 "Turn":128)
        % Baronian (2005), from Quebec, claimed that he used his "dialecte maternel" during interviews in Lafourche, St Martin, and Vermilion (137)
          % Given that he interview Creole speakers in St Martin, this suggests that he could understand them and they him
        % Neumann (1985) reported that creolophones understood Cajun (29)
      % The issue of maintaining two discrete social constructs
        % Even in accepted monolingual situations, it's important to distinguish between the languages of individuals and community languages
          % Pierrehumbert (2012) acknowledged that we can conceptualize lexicons at either the individual or the community level (173)
          % Fasold (1991) described treating speech communities as sharing structural constraints as "fatally flawed" (9-10)
            % Meaning that members of a same community do not all necessarily have the same grammars in their heads
          % Horvath & D. Sankoff (1987) noted that the resulting "grammar" produced when using social groups as a unit of analysis is a sort of "'average' grammar representative of no one speaker" (184)
          % Lightfoot (1999), likewise, distinguished between "grammars", which are "biological entities represented in individual mind/brains" versus "languages", which are "the aggregate output of some set of grammars" (77)
            % More specifically, he proposed social grammars as a corpus of sentences belonging to some socially or politically defined entity (Lightfoot 1999:97)
            % In either case, he did not consider "languages" to be cohesive systems as the grammars of individuals are (Lightfoot 1999:79/81)
        % In some cases, creoles have been considered distinct from their lexifiers based on their abrupt formation creating a genetic break between the two (e.g., Thomason & Kaufman 1988, as cited in Aboh & deGraff 2017:8-9) and/or the proposal of the criteria that genetic relatedness requires an unbroken succession of native speakers (e.g., Labov 2007; Ringe et al. 2002, both as cited in Aboh & deGraf 2017:25)
          % I would argue that the idea of genetic relationships between languages is a social construct to begin with and so the existence of a break is a sociopolitical debate, but what is clear empirical fact is that linguistic features have diffused from speakers of the lexifier language to speakers of the substrates
        % For others, maintaining two discrete social constructs is an issue of how to maintain, valorize, and in some cases, revitalize creoles
          % This has been an issue for AAL
            % Baugh (2015) was emphatic that AAVE is English (766-767)
            % The Oakland School Board Ebonics controversy was centered around whether AAL can be considered a distinct language (Rickford 1997 "Unequal":176)
        % In the end, as social constructs, as Terracher (1914) noted long ago, a creole becomes its own distinct language when speakers consider it a language (as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:69)
      % Structural blurring of boundaries between French and Creole
        % Even in studies of bilingualism, there is debate over the degree to which separate "languages" have shared versus distinct grammars
          % A bivalent word is one which is ambiguously part of either of the two langauges to which its bilingual user has access (Woolard 1999, as cited in Bell 2014:119)
            % This sort of ambiguity gives rise to the question
          % This goes back at least to Swadesh's (1941) claim that a bilingual's identical sounds all belong to a single system, so that where the two languages have an identical sound there's simply one mental representation (as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:8)
          % The BIA+ model of language processing argues for shared lexicons (Dijkstra & Van Heuven 2002)
          % Roberts & Siyanova-Chanturia (2013) argued that previous studies have shown that there is one mental lexicon for all languages in a bilingual's mind as words from all languages become activated during reading (221)
          % Altarriba et al. (1996) argued that previous work had shown that bilinguals have multiple lexicons that are all tied to one set of representations (478-479)
          % The input switch theory of language processing argues that bilinguals process language by activating the required language and deactivating the other (Macnamara & Kushnir 1971, as cited in Spivey & Marian 1999:281)
            % This was not supported by Spivey & Marian's (1999) experiment with Russian-English bilinguals (283)
        % Valdman & Klingler (1997) claimed that "LC is probably the French-based Creole that is closest to French structurally" (111)
        % This is particularly prevalent in Lafayette, Breaux Bridge, and Vacherie (Klingler 2003 "Language":78), the former two being where much of my data comes from.
        % Klingler (2005) suggested that French and Creole could be distinguished by the morphosyntax systems as the vocabularies are mostly shared (352)
          % Clifton (1975) specifically suggested that most of the differences lie in the syntax (as cited in Neumann 1985:54)
          % Neumann (1985), on the other hand, said that decreolization in morphosyntax and phonology occurred in the direction of Cajun (46)
          % But Neumann (1985) agreed that there are very few vocabulary differences between French and Creole (52)
        % Klingler (2003 "Language", 2005) used 1sg subject pronouns, past perfective constructions, and the verb 'to have' as diagnostics for structurally disentangling French and Creole (80)
          % 1sg was a better option than other pronouns, such as 3sg, because in the latter case, the pronouns il and li can be reduced in both French and Creole, respectively, to [i] (Klingler 2003 "Language":80)
            % This is notable because it inadvertantly gives us another example of the difficulty in drawing a structural boundary between French and Creole
          % Wendte (2022) admitted that "there are many commonalities between these two varieities--especially phonologically and lexically," but claimed that subject pronouns, "particles" indicating tense, and the verbs "gin", "olé", and "kouri" represent "salient distinctions" between French and Creole (98)
            % He seems to mean salient for the linguist but not necessarily for speakers
            % This is again a diagnostic, then
          % These diagnostics highlight the relevance (for Klingler and Wendte at least) of subject pronoun forms for distinguishing different ways of speaking
        % There are other examples of structurally ambiguous language use, though
          % Neumann (1985) argued that decreolization is most evident in noun phrases (77)
          % Baronian (2005) found that those in St Martin Parish (but not Vermilion or Lafourche (139)) followed the negative impertive syntax of Creole speakers (verb + pas + pronoun) regardless of whether they spoke Creole or French (137)
            % St Martin contains Breaux Bridge, noted by Klingler (2003 "Language") as being a town where French and Creole are in great contact
            % Baronian (2005) wasn't clear on how he distinguished between French and Creole, but did give examples, and those examples were identical save for the use of mo and gain in Creole speech (135), much like what Klingler (2003 "Language", 2005) did
          % Disjunctive pronouns are sometimes used in place of object clitic object pronouns (e.g., s'il a pu rencontrer elle) (Conwell & Juilland 1963, as cited in Rottet 1995:214)
          % Use of moi alone as a subject pronoun in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Rottet 1995:178) and mid 20th century Vermilion Parish (Brandon 1955, as cited in Rottet 1995:181)
            % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, moi could also reduce to [m] before a vowel, as with one high proficiency speaker producing phrases such as "M'arais eu zen si m'arais eu faim" (Rottet 1995:179)
          % Historically, universal quantification of nouns in Creole has been accomplished as in English (i.e., without a determiner), but this is now more commonly done as in French with definite articles either pre- or post-posed (Neumann 1985:54)
          % Gender
            % Didn't exist for some in Pointe Coupee Creole except for cases where there is a semantic contrast related to the referent in Pointe Coupee Creole (cousin vs cousine) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":170)
            % "[P]articularly for younger speakers," gender is not always expressed in adjectives in Terrebonne-Lafourche French where they instead all take the masculine form (Papen & Rottet 1997:89)
              % A lack of gender is usually described as a Creole feature but apparently show up in "French"
              % Some of my speakers also didn't seem to have a gendered adjectives, though gender was one of the things that Oliver Gomez explicitly described as something that is so ingrained that it never leaves you
            % On the other hand, Neumann (1985) reported grammatical gender sometimes showing up for articles, whether definite or indefinite or pre- or post-nominal, possessive determiners and pronouns, and adjectives among creolophones (58-59)
        % Klingler (2005) offered a failsafe for when it simply is not possible to identify a matrix language in a F&C clause: consider the existence of a language continuum in line with what Marshall (1987) proposed for Vacherie (360-364)
          % Such continuums were themselves originally prosposed to deal with how difficult it can be to draw a line between what is Creole structure and what is lexifier structure in other creole situations
          % DeCamp (1971/1974) proposed creole continuums when looking at what he called post-creole speech communities (i.e., communities where decreolization is occurring) (DeCamp 1968)
            % Decreolization likewise implies a close enough structural relationship that one could hypothesize that a creole would get absorbed back into a lexifier language
        % Analogously, Aboh & deGraff (2017) argued for a genetic relationship between French and Haitian Creole as a number of preverbal markers "have straightforward etyma in French morphemes in periphrastic verbal constructions whose meanings often overlap with those of the corresponding TMA+V combinations in" (10-11)
          % Aboh & deGraff (2017) discuss te, ap, the verbal suffix -e, future a(va), fini, sòt, and dwe (10)
            % Detges (2000) also cites uses of être après reported by Pomier (1835) (152)
            % Detges (2000) links the Mauritian Creole future marker pou to the use of être pour to express the near future in 1880 French (145)
          % Many of the markers of Louisiana Creole can likewise be interpreted as more or less still corresponding semantically and functionally with their French correlates
            % Neumann (1985) argued that Creole was a distinct language from French on the basis of preverbal markers (81)
            % Perhaps a New Orleans variety of Creole
              % Alé for future, sra for the future anterior, té for past imperfective, sré for conditional, apé for present [probably means progressive] (Fortier 1884:108)
            % Past
              % Habitual
                % té in Breaux Bridge (Neumann 1985:61-62)
              % Perfect aspect
                % "been" in Breaux Bridge (Neumann 1985:75)
                % Perfect aspect expressed with bin [bɪn] in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":262-263)
            % Future
              % The simple future is expressed with "a" in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":258-259)
                % sa in Breaux Bridge (Neumann 1985:62)
              % Ale is common in St Tammany Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":260)
            % Progressive
              % e (mostly), ap, and ape in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":255)
              % Past and present progressive in Terrebonne-Lafourche are produced with être après (Papen & Rottet 1997:102)
            % Conditional
              % se in Breaux Bridge (Neumann 1985:62)
              % se in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":261)
                % Habitual past is expressed with se for some speakers in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":261)
                % The conditional is also also occasionally used in the French of Terrebonne-Lafourche for the habitual past, which was argued to be from English influence (Papen & Rottet 1997:100)
            % ka(pa(b)) is presented as a verb in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":247) and as simultaneously an auxiliary verb and a marker in Breaux Bridge Creole (Neumann 1985:223)
              % Neumann (1985) also include pe 'peut' as equivalently an auxiliary and a marker, though for both kapab and pe, she draws the connection with être capable de and pouvoir plainly (223)
              % In Pointe Coupee, pas comes after pe but before kapab (Klingler 2003 "Turn":275)
                % Although this is also a difference between ve and oler, respectively (Klingler 2003 "Turn":276)
            % Valdman & Klingler (1997) argue that ape, te, va/ale/sa, and se are "verbal markers" rather than auxiliaries because auxiliaries can't be followed by NP predicates (125-127)
              % An auxiliary has been defined as a verb-like word element in a clause that expresses grammatical information such as tense, aspect, and modality (Anderson 2011:797-802; Heine 1993:22)
              % This leaves both elements like kapab as well as ole as auxiliaries. The rationale is odd as Heine (1997) cites work from as far back as 1973 that argues that auxiliaries can be main verbs, and indeed what they show in their data is that ole can and kapab can't, probably because these are in fact best analyzed as their French equivalent vouloir and capable. Likewise, their "markers" include, by their own admission, can all be used as main verbs other than ape and se (though I suspect se can even if an example isn't available or at least isn't clear given homophony with se as in c'est)
            % Syntactic order
              % te + pa + e in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":26/258)
              % te + bin + pas in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":263)
              % Relative to verbs, pa comes before those expressing habitual present and before those expressing any other tense+aspect, regardless of short or long form (Klingler 2003 "Turn":320-321)
                % Some verbs have pa invariably preceding them in Pointe Coupee: bezòn, fini, gen, kapab, konne, kouri, ole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":322)
              % With other markers, pa comes after all markers except ape and ale in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":26)
        % On a sociopolitical level, these similarities in structure can be obscured in particular via choices in how to represent creoles orthographically
      % Spelling convention used in this study
        % It has been argued for British Creole that non-standard spelling functions both as a way to represent a language that has no orthographic standard as well as a way to distance itself from its superstrate when words could be spelled the same but aren't, such as <Jameka> or <kool> (Sebba 1998, as cited in Androutsopoulos 2000:515)
        % Bengali and Hindi speakers who mix English into their online writing in the former languages sometimes write the former languages using the Roman script for convenience (Barman et al. 2014:13)
          % Likewise, writing here using French orthographic conventions is not a stance on the primacy of French but rather a matter of convenience
    \subsection{Regional and social variation in F\&C}
      \label{sec:reg_socio_variation}
      % Possessive forms such as noukenne (Fortier 1884:107)
        % Also attested in Pointe Coupee (Klingler 2003 "Turn":187-188)
        % These are only described in grammars of what is labeled Creole, but speakers who have otherwise almost none of the other features from those grammars certainly produce this form, as well
          % e.g., YouTube interview with Canray Fontenot, my interview with Patrick Patin (I think)
      % Qui has been attested as 'what' in Terrebonne-Lafourche, Vermilion, and Avoyelles (Papen & Rottet 1997:105)
      % Noun agglutinations
        % l-, n-, and z- can vary even within the speech of a single speaker in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":160)
        % Agglutinations are dropped when the noun is preceded by a preposition in fixed expressions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":162)
      % Post-posed articles
        % 19th century Creole in New Orleans
          % -la (sg), -layé (pl) (definite), -cila (sg), -cilayé (pl) (demonstrative) (Fortier 1884:105-106)
        % Pointe Coupee Creole speakers produced -la (sg) and -yé (pl) for definite determiners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":65/84/172)
        % St Tammany speakers produce -le (pl) definite determiners (Klingler 2003 "Turn":84)
        % Pointe Coupee Creole has -sa-la (sg) and -sa-ye (pl) for a demonstrative determiner and sometimes -sa (Klingler 2003 "Turn":65/181-182)
        % These aren't exclusive, as les is produced, as well
          % In Pointe Coupee, les generally comes before plural person nouns and time expressions (Klingler 2003 "Turn":174-175)
          % In Pointe Coupee, les is attested as being combined with -sa-ye (Klingler 2003 "Turn":182) and in Breaux Bridge with les + -sa-la(-la) is the most common form for the demonstrative (Klingler 2003 "Turn":183)
          % Similarly, in Pointe Coupee, des is sometimes produced as a plural indefinite article (Klingler 2003 "Turn":172)
          % In my own data, les appears to be the default, and instead -yé only occurs in possessive constructions, presumably because les is replaced by a possessive determiner, and possessive determiners for these speakers aren't marked for number
          % These cases are simply more examples of the blurring of the boundary between what one would call French vs Creole
      % Morphology
        % Number
          % Didn't exist in Pointe Coupee Creole (Klingler 2003 "Turn":170)
          % In the Barataria-Terrebonne basin, B. Brown (2003) reported participants pronouncing a final -s to mark plural nouns (16-17)
      % Prepositions
        % From (i.e., out of) was expressed in Pointe Coupee Creole with dans, en-dans, or NULL (Klingler 2003 "Turn":356/360)
      % Non-subject pronouns
        % Preverbal en has been replaced by postverbal z'en for some speakers (Rottet 1995:218)
      % English influence
        % This is typical for many declining languages in contact with English
          % Romani in England has borrowed English grammar and vocabulary to the point where "only a few hundred words" from Romani remain (Bell 2014:91)
        % Louisiana isn't the only place where English has found its way into French, sometimes in similar ways to Louisiana in these other places
          % English was being used in Acadian French by the 1940s at least to the extent that borrowed verbs took inflections (Massignon 1962, as cited in King 2000:2)
          % Chiac in Dieppe in 1991 and 2000 has "back", "much", "but", and "so" among others (Perrot 2014) and SE New Brunswick in general (Roy 1979, as cited in King 2008)
            % "Back" was found in Prince Edward Island (King 2000, as cited in King 2008:161-162)
            % "Back" is also found in Ontario (Hull 1955; Canale et al. 1977, both cited in King 2008:158-159)
          % Quebec French (Poplack & Dion 2012)
        % Two Cajun women (73 and 88) from Gonzales produced code-switching in an interview (B. Brown 1986:401)
          % She characterized these women as speaking English and "Cajun"
          % She argues the English influence is on both a lexical and structural level (400)
          % Types: 54 emblematic vs 28 intimate, meaning most switches were single nouns, and 82 conversational vs 3 situational, meaning switches didn't involve changes in participants or subjects (403)
            % The emblematic switches often involve modern technologies (B. Brown 1986:400-401)
              % This is also the case in the Creole of Breaux Bridge, where English makes up most of the vocabulary for politics, economics, teaching, and other modern domains (Neumann 1985:71)
            % It's not always clear if such lone other-language items are code-switches or borrowings (Poplack & Dion 2012), so they've been referred to in various ways
              % Cultural borrowed forms (Myers-Scotton 1993/1997:169) or cultural code switch in (Ehresmann & Bousquette 2015:238)
                % Ehresmann & Bousquette (2015) establish this via deduction, which in their case of Wisconsin West Frisian, meant considering whether the referents existed by the time the speakers' ancestors had immigrated or not (239)
                  % This is a common explanation of which words get borrowed, for example Spanish speakers in Tampa, Florida borrowing a lot of baseball terms (Ortoz 1949, as cited in Weinreich 1953/1967:52)
        % Lexical items
          % English borrowings go back at least as far as the 1930s in Evangeline Parish (H. Smith & Phillips 1939:199)
            % At this time, French was legally no longer allowed to be the language of instruction, so H. Smith & Phillips (1939) suggested that this was the source of English borrowings (198-199)
            % H. Smith & Phillips (1939) found most English borrowings in Evangeline Parish were nouns and verbs which could be pronounced as in English or using French phonology (199-201)
              % Nouns were also very common among Puerto Ricans in NYC (Poplack 1979/1980/2000:226)
            % Borrowed English verbs are either left bare or placed in the -er class in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Papen & Rottet 1997:95)
              % I came across both strategies in my data
          % B. Brown (2003) found that English lexical borrowings occurred at a high rate among her participants in the Barataria-Terrebonne basin (3-4)
          % "So" as a conjunction in Terrebonne-Lafourche among both Cajuns and Indians (Rottet 1995:129)
          % "But" has been documented and analyzed in Terrebonne-Lafourche in 2006 (Dajko & Carmichael 2014)
          % Neumann (1985) claimed that decreolization along lexical and morphological lines was towards English (46)
          % Neumann (1985) claimed that English most influences Creole in its lexicon (70)
        % French also has influenced the English spoken in Louisiana, for example B. Brown's (1986) two participants produced phrases like "he went in France" and "I love gumbo, cher" (400)
          % Dubois & Horvath's (2003) study of "Cajun Vernacular English" had men producing phrases such as "Me I went to the store" and "I've been married with my wife during twenty years" (37)
          % "Mais" has been attested in the English of young non-francophones in Terrebonne-Lafourche (Dajko & Carmichael 2014:165)
            % This is doubly interesting since this study looked specifically at the use of "but" in French there
      % Geographic variation
        % Klingler (2005) found that speakers in Pointe Coupee used Creole-marked variants and in St Landry French-marked variants for 1sg pronouns, past perfective, and the verb 'to have' (354-356)
        % Almost all of the variants marked as Creole (by Klingler, 1sg subject pronouns, perfective aspect representation, and the verb 'to have') used by speakers in St Landry Parish were produced by 4 speakers from Leonville, Prairie Ville, and Arnaudville (Klingler 2003 "Language":83).
          % These towns are all along Bayou Teche which historically was lined with plantations (Klingler 2003 "Language":83)
          % Most variants were marked as French in general
          % Most Creole variants were also used by Blacks, though not exclusively (some White Cajuns used Creole-marked perfective aspect)
        % Almost all variants of 1sg pronouns, perfective aspect, and the verb 'to have' used by speakers in Pointe Coupee (3 Black, 2 White) were variants marked as Creole save for some tokens (~7%) of 'avoir' used only by Whites (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
          % For 1sg specifically, only 2 tokens were not mo, and those 2 tokens were null rather than je (Klingler 2003 "Language":81)
      % Ethnic variation
        % Phonetic variation
          % J. Johnson (1976) claimed that Cajuns in the 1970s pronounced <oi> pronounced as [wɛ] and had distinct lexical features such as amarrer, haler, asteur, and English borrowings (31-32)
            % It's not clear why he mentions English borrowings for Cajuns as he does mention this for New Orleans Creoles, as well
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, the article les is produced as [lø] by Cajuns and [lo] by Indians (Rottet 1995:128)
        % Morphology
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Cajuns preferred /e/ on verbs to make them agree with vous whereas Indians preferred NULL endings regardless of whether vous was used as a singular or plural pronoun (Rottet 1995:194/199)
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, Cajuns used the subjunctive more than Indians, though both had low usage (24% and 5%, respectively) (Rottet 1995:265)
          % In Terrebonne-Lafourche, both Cajuns and Indians produced agglutination, but Indians produced it more often (Rottet 1995:129)
      % Racial variation
        % Several features differ along racial lines in Pointe Coupee Creole
          % Whites tend to pronounce rounded front vowels more often, whereas the rounding is more regularly lost among Blacks (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites tend to pronounce word final and preconsonantal rs more regularly. Whites also use the affricate /tʃ/ in place of /k/ more often (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
            % In Breaux Bridge, Neumann (1985) found something of the opposite in that Whites didn't use the affricates /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ in place of /tj/ and /dj/ as these were considered speaking "nègre" (91)
            % Neumann (1985) did however find the Whites in Breaux Bridge were also the ones to pronounce post-vocalic /r/ more often (95)
          % Whites use gender and number agreement for adjectives and determiners much more often (e.g., se zekla vs so zekla-ye and ma manman vs mo manman and mo (f.) movèz vs mo move) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":116)
          % Whites use determiners that are closer to French and that agree in gender and/or number (e.g. lœrtchèn vwazinaj vs yekèn vwazinaj and tou le paròl-sa-la vs tou paròl-sa-ye) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites tend to use d(e) to indicate a relation between nouns where blacks will just juxtapose the nouns (e.g. enn mezon-d-ekòl vs enn lamezon-ekòl for schoolhouse) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Whites sometimes pronounce the past tense marker te and the clause final copula ye as ete and e, respectively (Klingler 2003 "Turn":119)
          % Whites tend to use a stem without the final e (or equivalent) in the habitual present and the 2nd person singular imperative, whereas blacks tend to use one long stem invariably in all contexts (Klingler 2003 "Turn":117)
          % Irregular verbs like to have, to want, and to can take French-like conjugations in the speech of Whites but less in the speech of Blacks (e.g. nou u vs nou te gen and tou me katen ave vs tou mo katen-ye te gen and cochon-la voule vs cochon-la t'ole and ye peu pa parle vs ye pa kapab pale and mo poura chante vs mo sa kapab chante) (Klingler 2003 "Turn":118)
        % Neumann (1985) looked at Blacks in her study of Breaux Bridge Creole because she claimed that their language was «moins affectés par la "décréolisation"» (2)
          % Neumann (1985) reported that towns where Whites spoke Creole were Henderson, Cecilia, Catahoula, and Kraemer (40)
            % These speakers differed in that they did not used post-nominal yé and did have grammatical gender marked in their determiners (Neumann 1985:41)
